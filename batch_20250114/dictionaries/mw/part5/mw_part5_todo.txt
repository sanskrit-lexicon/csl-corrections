The simple-display has a limitation:  If two entries for a headword
  are far apart, only the first (based on L-number) appears in the 
  list (hierarchy) pane; UI provides no way to recenter the hierarchy for the second one.
  By contrast, this hierarchy-recentering feature is present in the list display.
    The list display does not show 'a','b' pseudo-homonyms in hierarchy pane.
  Example: in MW, headword Seza (slp1).

* TODOy Case 25: 11/03/2024 dict=MW, L=5238.2, hw=anarman, user=srhodes
old = Two Headwords (looking alike)
new = I am uncertain whether the two Headwords "anarman" should be further distinguished in the Hierarchy List. The Eytmology (parsing) of course is different, and I see that the "accent" as well is different. However, the appearance in the Hierarchy list remains identical. Should the letter "a" and the letter "b" be added for distinguishing a difference between the two?

* TODOy Case 35: 11/04/2024 dict=MW, L=4511.1, hw=adhyeya, user=srhodes
old = Number 1 Missing in Hierarchy List
new = Please note that this Headword is specifically "adhyeya 1" deriving from "adhi-√i", and it is obviously to be distinguished from "adhyeya 2" which is parsed beginning with the negative particle "a". Therefore, I recommend that the number "1" be displayed in the Hierarchy List. ALSO, Please note that this Headword "adhyeya 1" belongs to the existing Main Entry "adhy-eya, mfn. to be read. [ID=4510]", and therefore the Supplemental Addition "adhyeya 1" should NOT be separated from the primary Main Entry in the Hierarchy List. As you will see, currently, the Headword "adhyetṛ  [ID=4511]" COMES BETWEEN the Doubly Listed Headword "adhyeya". So, I am recommending three things to be done: 1) Be sure that the two Headwords "adhyeya" (listed twice) follow each other without interruption by the Headword "adhyetṛ";  2) You may even consider to eliminate the Double Listing of the Headword "adhyeya" since it is actually one and the SAME word deriving from "adhi-√i", simply with the addition of a Supplemental Definition;  3) I also suggest specifically marking this now singular occurence of "adhyeya" as "adhyeya 1" (with the number 1 in the Hierarchy Display) so as to distinguish it from the Homonym "adhyeya 2" which is parsed beginning with the negative particle "a". The fact is this: BOTH the Main Entry as well as the Supplement specifically refer to "adhyeya 1" as distinguished from "adhyeya 2" which is parsed beginning with the negative particle "a".

* TODOx Case 101: 11/08/2024 dict=MW, L=1730, hw=aṅgulisaṃdaṃśa, user=srhodes
old = Revision Update
new = Please note that the original definition MUST be 'crossed out', YET displayed in MW Dictionary online. 
I consider this Revision to be 'dangerous' and actually an error! 
As Andhrabharati has noted, "Scott likes to check other dictionaries: Apte, Shabda etc." I check other dictionaries because for my own dictionary I am integrating all information from all reliable sources.
 The word "aṅgulisaṃdeśa" which has been revised by Monier-Williams is spelled by Apte and Shabda as "aṅgulisandeśa". If we look up the word "saṃdeśa or sandeśa" and then "integrate" the meaning of the compound "aṅgulisaṃdeśa", we will find that this is a LEGITIMATE word in the Sanskrit Language and should NOT be cancelled! 
In fact I am shocked at the audacity of Monier-Williams! I have heard it said that in the Sanskrit Language there exist Two Million manuscripts that predate the printing press, whereas in the Greek Language the number is a mere twenty thousand. I would like to meet someone who has read all two million manuscripts! Therefore, speaking metaphorically, I take the entire Sanskrit Language as "ākṛtigaṇa" and I do not "close the door" on any possible (and legitimate) word. In fact the masters of language are allowed to 'coin' words (even at times in violation of the rules of grammar). All this being said, for my own dictionary I include both words "aṅgulisaṃdaṃśa" AND "aṅgulisandeśa or aṅgulisaṁdeśa" with a slight variation in meaning according to the "uttarapada" (in each case).

What we find in the Annexure is the following Supplementary Additions: “1. Aṅkura (in comp.)”; then of course the proper following compounds; “2. Aṅkura” which itself has been correctly added to the Main Entry. What is to be done here?
 LB —I propose that "1. Aṅkura" be marked as a "print change" and left exactly as it is, of course with the deletion of the "circle-R" Symbol.
 LB ——This also touches on another point raised recently by Andhrabharati regarding “compound” headings in the annexure. This is my view on the matter:  In cases like "aṅkura", since the Headword already exists in the Main Entry, there is no need to add the additional “aṅkura” from the annexure that precedes the Supplemental compounds, because this will be obious from the proper placement after the existing Headword “Aṅkura” in the Main Entry. In such cases, the “Aṅkura’” heading in the annexure is ONLY serving the purpose of indicating the “pūrvapada” for the following supplementary compounds, but this is already obvious in the Main Entry by the very fact of the Existing Headword “Aṅkura”. I suggest that we ONLY add the “pūvapada” Compound Headword from the annexure into the Main Entry in cases where it simply does not already exist, which of course is less common, but then such a Supplementary Insertion into the Main Entry will be required to make clear the “pūrvapada” Compound Headword and following compounds which will all be inserted from the annexure into the Main Entry and marked accordingly.

The specification "m." can mean two things: 1) it can signify the masuline gender, which in this case is impossible because the "Brahma" being referenced is either "Brahma neuter" OR "Brahman neuter", but definitely NOT "Brahma or Brahman" masculine. The fact is that "the {Supreme/impersonal} Spirit" is being intended here and that is ALWAYS in the neuter gender; Also, the neuter gender should carry through to the end of the definition: there should be no change to "masculine". 2) So does MW desire to change "Brahma" to read "Brahmam" in order to make explicit the neuter Gender Definition?

**Jim comment: 
Annexure text page 1309,1:

In text page 5,1  There is only one instance of 'Brahma':
  "(am), n. anthing that is beyond the cognizance of the senses;
   Brahma; the not being seen, absence;"

new = I see the following on the printed page: 
 LB 1. a-kṣaṇvat mfn. (√kṣan), not injuring, ĀśvGṛ. [ID=541]
 LB 2. akṣan—vat mfn. having eyes, RV. [ID=669]

 LB ←  (H3) [Printed book page 1308,2]
 LB akṣan-vat see akṣaṇ-vat. [ID=670.1 sup]
 LB HOWEVER, this all seems a bit questionable. The "supposed" Homonyms have DIFFERENT spellings! Therefore, I do not consider them to be TRUE Homonyms. In my opinion, I would DELETE the Supplement: "akṣan-vat see akṣaṇ-vat. [ID=670.1 sup]" which simply exacerbates the issue. Then I would remove the number "1" and "2" from "1. akṣaṇvat [ID=541] AND 2. akṣan—vat [ID=669]" AND mark this as a "print change". Here is an analogy in the English Language: the word "rite" AND "right" are obviously NOT Homonyms. Same in Sanskrit! In fact The Sanskrit Language prides itself on detail, and therefore I am simply appalled at the MW analysis here.

new = APTE has solved the mystery. This Headword in MW Dictionary is Spelled Incorrectly! I have checked the actual ṚgVeda Citation! Please enjoy the following: "Having eyes; akṣaṇvaṃtaḥ karṇavaṃtaḥ Rv. 10. 71. 7." This is direct from the Veda, and I do not recommend changing the spelling as MW Dictionary has done. Therefore, this word is correctly a Homonym, but it must be spelled as "akṣaṇvat" which is DIRECT from the Ṛgveda, and which MW dictionary is itself referencing. Therefore this spelling error MUST be corrected and marked as a "print change". I am taking a break! (Super-Duper-kaching!)

old = ONE FINAL NOTE
new = I see that on the printed page this Headword is listed as "akṣan—vat". The important point to note is the following: the pūrvapada "akṣan" correctly ends in a dental letter "n", however due to Sandhi rules, when the affix "vat" is added the dental letter "n" MUST be changed to the cerebral letter "ṇ" giving the word "akṣaṇvat". But in fact the word was not printed "in full" on the printed page. So the "error" has officially occurred only in MW online where headwords are spelled out in full, and this of course requires proper Sandhi rule application. I still consider this Supplement from the annexure: "akṣan-vat see akṣaṇ-vat. [ID=670.1 sup]" TO BE Confusing, misleading and not helpful; therefore I would simply ommitt it from MW online and mark as a "print change"; THAT reminds of role call, where the (mūḍha) teacher says, "Please raise your hand if your are not present!"

1) the ID number being referenced here [ID=235217] REFERS ONLY to the verb "sam-√ud". The placement is correct, but the OTHER definitions relate to an ENTIRELY different Headword "sa-mud". Please notice the difference between the UPASARGA "sam" used in the verb "sam-ud" AND the prefix "sa" used with the non-verb "sa-mud". VERY DIFFERENT WORDS! They Should NOT be "tied together" in the SAME Window Display! 
status = PENDING

**Jim comment: slight change to  235217.1 "conversation". 
  the print (p. 1332,3) shows "sam-ud"
   (with the '-' at a linebreak).  Also there is accent (sam-u/d)
 Based on "sam-ud", the position of 235217.1
is proper. (analogous to the verb dfS and the noun dfS)
  I'll add "sam-ud" to this, for emphasis.
  Note: if "conversation" were for "sa-mud", then we would move 235217.1 to after 235354

new = TYPO – Please note that there are ONLY two Headwords named: "samud": 
 LB 1)  the verb "sam-√ud. [ID=235217]"
 LB 2) "sa-mud mfn. joyful, glad, Śiś. [ID=235354]"
 LB This second "samud mfn. [ID=235354]" is ALREADY properly located here: BETWEEN the Headword "samunna [ID=235353]" AND the Headword "sam-ud-√añc [ID=235355]".
 LB 3) Therefore this THIRD listing of the Headword "samud [ID=235217.1 sup]" is ERRONEOUS. Of course the Supplemental Addition does exist, BUT it should be included with the existing Headword "sa-mud [ID=235354]"
 LB 4) Now, I admit that I may be WRONG in some part of what has been stated here. The Supplemental Headword "samud [ID=235217.1 sup]" may have a differentiating accent that requires a THIRD listing of the Headword "samud", but then you can see this all begins to get confusing. So I leave up to Jim and Andhrabharati as to what needs to be done here.
 LB 5) BUT CERTAINLY this Supplemental Headword "accord. to some = ‘conversation’, AV. viii, 1, 15. [ID=235217.1 sup]" SHOULD NOT BE LUMPED TOGETHER with the verb form "sam-√ud. [ID=235217]" NOR SHOULD IT BE LOCATED (and indented) in the Hierarchy after the verb: "samund [ID=235217.05]".

I have checked the under the direction specified: "(for 2. See vi-√dhṛ)" AND I find no listing for "2. vidharma". Therefore this is a SERIOUS "print change". ALSO, you may choose to add the word "vidharmaka" (mentioned here) as a searchable Headword with the appropriate definition being: "vi-dharmaka mfn. wrong, unjust, unlawful". ALSO, for my own dictionary, I have placed the word "vidharmaka" AFTER the proper compound "vidharmastha". However, you may consider this to be a "group" (vidharma and vidharmaka) and place accordingly. I consider most "bahiraṅga groups" (metaphorically speaking) to be HAPPENSTANCE (unless perhaps in related names of the same individual) and do not give them much attention in my own dictionary. I do however prioritize the "antaraṅga groups" which I consider to be an absolute grammatical fact of the Sanskrit language.

new = I recommend to DELETE the second occurrence of this Headword and retain the first instance along with the "circle-S" Supplement Symbol. I see that this Supplement is part of a "group" with the Headword "vindhyavāsaka", however this does not require that the Headword "vindhyavāsin" should be Doube Listed to "accomodate" the group. Please consider this, you cannot have the NAME "vindhyavāsin" without it bearing direct relation to the EXISTING Headword of that same title. For example, if someone has the name "Idiot", it will be very difficult to convince other people that he is not an Idiot (having such a name). ALSO, I would recommend relocating the Supplementary definition in the Window Display of the Headword "vindhyavāsin" to BELOW the Main Entry Definition. In my view, a Supplementary "Group" should not take precedence over the Main Entry Definition itself. As I have mentioned before, a "group" such as this is simply Happenstance. The fact of "vindhyavāsin" being the N. of a Sāṃkhya teacher is not "antaraṅga" (metaphorically speaking) to the Sanskrit Language itself. Therefore the Main Entry Definition which derives "antaraṅga" from the Sanskrit Language itself deserves precedence to this "Happenstance" grouping from the annexure.

* TODOx Case 240: 11/16/2024 dict=MW, L=193039.1, hw=vijāman, user=srhodes
old = EMERGENCY
new = There are TWO Headwords: 
1) the first is correctly placed as “vi—jāman mfn. related, corresponding. [ID=193039]”; 
2) the second is MISSING! This Missing Headword is different by accent and placement: “vijā́man”; this Headword is located on the printed page of the Main Entry immediately following the Headword: "vijāta mfn. [ID=194974]”. This MISSING Headword: “vijā́man” has its own placement separate and distinct from "vijāman mfn. [ID=193039]”. So Perhaps there needs to be some numbering as “1” and “2” added to these two words which differ by accent and placement.
 LB ———NOW, another point of consideration regards the REVISION which applies only to the Missing Headword “vijā́man” which is located on the printed page of the Main Entry immediately following the Headword: "vijāta mfn. [ID=194974]”.
 LB ———SO FIRST: This Missing Headword “vijā́man” needs to be ADDED to the Hierarchy List in MW online after the Headword: "vijāta mfn. [ID=194974]”. 
 LB ———The original Main Entry for the Headword "vijā́man” prints: "vi-jā́man mfn. related i.e. corresponding to each other, symmetrical, RV.; AV.; ŚBr."
 LB ———THEN, the Revision itself needs to be reconsidered as the annexure prints as follows: 
  "vi-jā́man (read, ‘corresponding to each other,’ i.e. ‘being in pairs,’ ‘symmetrical’)." 

NOW COMPARE THAT with the currently existing Revision ONLINE (which remember has been 'pinned' to the wrong headword at the wrong location, because the correct Headword is absent from the Hierarchy List as explained above).
 vi-°jā́man (read ‘corresponding to each other’, i.e. ‘being in pairs’, ‘symmetrical’) [ID=193039.1 rev (1332,2)]

 LB ———As you can see, the above quoted Revision has NOT been properly implemented.
 LB ———The FINAL CORRECT REVISION SHOULD READ: 

"vi-jā́man mfn. corresponding to each other, i.e. being in pairs, symmetrical, RV.; AV.; ŚBr."

 LB ———Also, Please note that the added quotation marks, such as seen here: ‘corresponding to each other’ ARE NOT NEEDED in the actual implementation of the Revision. They simply serve the purpose of INDICATING the content of the Revision to be implemented.

new = In response to one of my submissions several months ago, you made the following comment: (I am paraphrasing) - "there are no adjectives in Sanskrit". Then please explain the definition given here: "(in Gr.) a noun which does not drop its original gender, when used as an adjective."
 LB Please address, in particular, the last five words of the previous sentence in relation to your previous comment cited above.
comment = Attention Jim
status = PENDING

**Jim comment: I'm not a grammarian, so take my comments with a grain of salt.
      Consider Kaga, which can be declined in all 3 genders. 
      This word can be used like an adjective "moving in air" So we could say "KagA mAlA" (odd image!)
      But we could also use it like a noun "one who moves in the air", "KagaH patati" The bird is flying.
      The one word "Kaga" can be used as a noun or as an adjective, according to expressive need.
      But Kaga is itself neither a noun or an adjective.  
      Thus melteth away another grain of salt.

comment = Typo – Please note that this is a possible Headword Typo and Print Change. Here is the reasoning: 1) Both APTE and the Great Vācaspatyam derive this word as "ajura" with the affix KuraC (where K and C are elided). Please consult the Pāṇini rule 3.2.162. Similarly derived words are: vidura, bhidura, chidura. Note that all end in the vowel "a", which of course is part of the KuraC affix. I hope that Andhrabharati will comment.
