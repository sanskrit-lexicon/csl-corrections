* TODOE Case 12: 11/03/2024 dict=MW, L=5874.1, hw=anirdaya, user=srhodes
old = Emergency
new = Please note that the “Emergency” pertains to the very next word listed in the Supplemental Section: “anirdāhuka, mfn. not burning or scorching, MaitrS.” Please note that this Headword “anirdāhuka” is MISSING FROM MW DICTIONARY ONLINE!!! (Super-Duper-kaching!) • Jackpot! • 100,000 points •

* TODOP Case 13: 11/03/2024 dict=MW, L=5707.4, hw=anāstha, user=srhodes
old = Placement Error
new = The supplemental insertion of this Headword should be placed just before the word "anāsthā [ID=5714]" in the Hierarchical listing of words. You may also choose to further "link" these two words since "anāsthā" is the feminine form, while "anāstha" is the adjective.

* TODOP Case 14: 11/03/2024 dict=MW, L=5684.1, hw=anāśvāsika, user=srhodes
old = Placement Error
new = The supplemental insertion of this Headword should be placed (without indentation) just before the word "anāṣṭra [ID=5704]" in the Hierarchical listing of words. The reasoning is as follows:  All of the compounds listed here under the Headword "anāśaka  [ID=5680]" derive from the verbal root: "2. aś [ID=19416]" (with the negative particle "an" as the initial prefix). However, the supplemental word under discussion: "anāśvāsika mfn. [ID=5684.1 sup]" derives from the prefixed root "ā-√śvas" with the negative particle "an" as the initial prefix. Therefore, the Etymology is entirely different; thus the relocation is necessary to please Pāṇini, Jim, Andhrabharati and Scott. (kaching!)

* TODODS Case 15: 11/03/2024 dict=MW, L=5645.2, hw=anālabdha, user=srhodes
old = Double Supplement
new = Words which have two supplementary definitions are somewhat common. I suggest for Jim to "force" a single "circle-S" Supplemental Insertion Symbol to the right side of this word in the Hierarchy List Display. There is no need for the Double "S S" – One supplemental indicator is sufficient for the job.

Now, two things remain to be done: 1) Mark the Headword "anāvṛtta [ID=5664]" as a REVISION with the "circle-R" symbol; 2) Give Scott a round of applause.

old = Placement Error
new = This is a unique Revision in that the spelling of the Headword itself has been changed. Now, the spelling correction (which has already been accomplished) requires the corrected Headword to be "Relocated" to its proper Etymological location, which in this case is just after the word "amalātman [ID=13993]" in the Hierarchical listing of words.

old = Supplement or Revision?
new = Please RECONSIDER: The Main Entry reads: "anarman mfn. = an-arvan, q.v., AV. vii, 7, 1." THEN IN THE SUPPLEMENT (OR REVISION), we read: "w.r. for an-arvan, AV. vii, 7, 1." Please NOTICE that the SOURCE cited as well as the DEFINITION given in both cases are IDENTICAL, with one IMPORTANT difference: In the main entry we read: "= an-arvan" and in the Revision(?) we read: "w.r. for an-arvan". It appears that the SECOND statement OVERRULES (or revises) the FIRST statement. The contest is: 1) "="  VERSUS  2) "w.r.". (kaching!)

* TODO Case 25: 11/03/2024 dict=MW, L=5238.2, hw=anarman, user=srhodes
old = Two Headwords (looking alike)
new = I am uncertain whether the two Headwords "anarman" should be further distinguished in the Hierarchy List. The Eytmology (parsing) of course is different, and I see that the "accent" as well is different. However, the appearance in the Hierarchy list remains identical. Should the letter "a" and the letter "b" be added for distinguishing a difference between the two?

old = Placement Error
new = The supplemental insertion of this Headword should be placed just before the word "ananvābhakta [ID=5058]" in the Hierarchical listing of words, according to Alphabetic order. Please note these words are parsed as "an-anu-ā-(etc.)" (in other word, the negative particle followed by two upasargas). Also there will no indentation in the Hierarchy List.

ALSO, please relocate the position of this (masculine gender) Supplemental Definition within the Display Window so as to follow the Main Entry Definition given for the Masculine Gender: "m. a neighbouring rival, a rival neighbour [ID=4993]".

old = Placement Error
new = The supplemental insertion of this Headword should be placed just after the word "anadhīyat [ID=4892.5 sup]" in the Hierarchical listing of words, according to Alphabetic order. Also, please note that the word "anadhīyāna" correctly follows the word "anadhīyat" in the Supplemental Section, and therefore when inserting both words into the Main Entry their relative position to each other cannot be reversed (especially since they are directly related)!

* TODO Case 34: 11/04/2024 dict=MW, L=4711.1, hw=adhyeya, user=srhodes
old = Number 2 Missing in Hierarchy List
new = Please note that this Headword is specifically "a-dhyeya 2", and obviously parsed beginning with the negative particle "a"; it is also obviously to be distinguished from "adhyeya 1" which derives from "adhi-√i". Therefore, I recommend that the number "2" be displayed in the Hierarchy List.
comment = Number 2 Missing in Hierarchy List  
status = PENDING  
 Jim Also see next case

------------------------------------------------------------------------

* TODO Case 35: 11/04/2024 dict=MW, L=4511.1, hw=adhyeya, user=srhodes
old = Number 1 Missing in Hierarchy List
new = Please note that this Headword is specifically "adhyeya 1" deriving from "adhi-√i", and it is obviously to be distinguished from "adhyeya 2" which is parsed beginning with the negative particle "a". Therefore, I recommend that the number "1" be displayed in the Hierarchy List. ALSO, Please note that this Headword "adhyeya 1" belongs to the existing Main Entry "adhy-eya, mfn. to be read. [ID=4510]", and therefore the Supplemental Addition "adhyeya 1" should NOT be separated from the primary Main Entry in the Hierarchy List. As you will see, currently, the Headword "adhyetṛ  [ID=4511]" COMES BETWEEN the Doubly Listed Headword "adhyeya". So, I am recommending three things to be done: 1) Be sure that the two Headwords "adhyeya" (listed twice) follow each other without interruption by the Headword "adhyetṛ";  2) You may even consider to eliminate the Double Listing of the Headword "adhyeya" since it is actually one and the SAME word deriving from "adhi-√i", simply with the addition of a Supplemental Definition;  3) I also suggest specifically marking this now singular occurence of "adhyeya" as "adhyeya 1" (with the number 1 in the Hierarchy Display) so as to distinguish it from the Homonym "adhyeya 2" which is parsed beginning with the negative particle "a". The fact is this: BOTH the Main Entry as well as the Supplement specifically refer to "adhyeya 1" as distinguished from "adhyeya 2" which is parsed beginning with the negative particle "a".

comment = Letter "b" Missing in Hierarchy List

* TODODS Case 40: 11/04/2024 dict=MW, L=4663.1, hw=adhyāśaya, user=srhodes
old = Double Supplement
new = Words which have two supplementary definitions are somewhat common. I suggest for Jim to "force" a single "circle-S" Supplemental Insertion Symbol to the right side of this word in the Hierarchy List Display. There is no need for the Double "S S" – One supplemental indicator is sufficient for the job. Actually, it is interesting to note that this is a "Triple Supplementary Listing" – I wonder why we don't see THREE "circle-S" symbols?
comment = Double Supplement

------------------------------------------------------------------------

* TODOQ Case 43: 11/04/2024 dict=MW, L=4615.1, hw=adhyavasāya, user=srhodes
old = See Below
new = I mention this as a point of interest: 
 for my own purposes I have split the word "adhyavasāya" into 
 "adhyavasāya 1"  and  "adhyavasāya 2". 
 In fact, "adhyavasāya 2" is correctly the absolute (indeclinable)
    meaning "having decided" (among other things). 
 Now, even more interesting is this: 
 Does this Supplemental Definition IN FACT belong to the
  absolute (indeclinable) form that I have just mentioned? I say, "Yes". 
 There is no gender given and the definition matches to the accepted format 
 for the absolute form: "clinging to (earthly things), Divyāv. [ID=4615.1 sup]". 
 Also I derive this absolute form form the double prefixed root 
 "adhi-ava-√so" which in fact has "grapple with" as one of the possible 
 definitions. 
 "grappling with" and "clinging to" are close enough to link all this together 
 as belonging to the absolute (indeclinable) form as I am suggesting. 
 Shall I start my own "MW Dictionary Sanskrit Daily" 
 column in the Cologne University Newspaper?
comment = See Above
status = PENDING Jim:  I like Scott's idea regarding having a place

new = The supplemental insertion of this Headword should be placed just after the word "aṅgulyādi [ID=1736]" in the Hierarchical listing of words. The reason for this is because in the annexure itself, we find the word "aṅgulikā" placed AFTER all of the proper "aṅguli-" compounds. Therefore, in the Main Entry itself, this ordering must be respected and it is simply the way things are done yathāpramāṇam!

old = Revision Update
new = Please note that the original definition MUST be 'crossed out', YET displayed in MW Dictionary online. I consider this Revision to be 'dangerous' and actually an error! As Andhrabharati has noted, "Scott likes to check other dictionaries: Apte, Shabda etc." I check other dictionaries because for my own dictionary I am integrating all information from all reliable sources. The word "aṅgulisaṃdeśa" which has been revised by Monier-Williams is spelled by Apte and Shabda as "aṅgulisandeśa". If we look up the word "saṃdeśa or sandeśa" and then "integrate" the meaning of the compound "aṅgulisaṃdeśa", we will find that this is a LEGITIMATE word in the Sanskrit Language and should NOT be cancelled! In fact I am shocked at the audacity of Monier-Williams! I have heard it said that in the Sanskrit Language there exist Two Million manuscripts that predate the printing press, whereas in the Greek Language the number is a mere twenty thousand. I would like to meet someone who has read all two million manuscripts! Therefore, speaking metaphorically, I take the entire Sanskrit Language as "ākṛtigaṇa" and I do not "close the door" on any possible (and legitimate) word. In fact the masters of language are allowed to 'coin' words (even at times in violation of the rules of grammar). All this being said, for my own dictionary I include both words "aṅgulisaṃdaṃśa" AND "aṅgulisandeśa or aṅgulisaṁdeśa" with a slight variation in meaning according to the "uttarapada" (in each case).

new = Please note that technically  speaking this is NOT a revision. Also, as you can see in the Display Window there is no Revision being indicated. What we find in the Annexure is the following Supplementary Additions: “1. Aṅkura (in comp.)”; then of course the proper following compounds; “2. Aṅkura” which itself has been correctly added to the Main Entry. What is to be done here?
 LB —I propose that "1. Aṅkura" be marked as a "print change" and left exactly as it is, of course with the deletion of the "circle-R" Symbol.
 LB ——This also touches on another point raised recently by Andhrabharati regarding “compound” headings in the annexure. This is my view on the matter:  In cases like "aṅkura", since the Headword already exists in the Main Entry, there is no need to add the additional “aṅkura” from the annexure that precedes the Supplemental compounds, because this will be obious from the proper placement after the existing Headword “Aṅkura” in the Main Entry. In such cases, the “Aṅkura’” heading in the annexure is ONLY serving the purpose of indicating the “pūrvapada” for the following supplementary compounds, but this is already obvious in the Main Entry by the very fact of the Existing Headword “Aṅkura”. I suggest that we ONLY add the “pūvapada” Compound Headword from the annexure into the Main Entry in cases where it simply does not already exist, which of course is less common, but then such a Supplementary Insertion into the Main Entry will be required to make clear the “pūrvapada” Compound Headword and following compounds which will all be inserted from the annexure into the Main Entry and marked accordingly.

The fact is that "the {Supreme/impersonal} Spirit" is being intended here and that is ALWAYS in the neuter gender; Also, the neuter gender should carry through to the end of the definition: there should be no change to "masculine". 2) So does MW desire to change "Brahma" to read "Brahmam" in order to make explicit the neuter Gender Definition?

The important point to note is the following: the pūrvapada "akṣan" correctly ends in a dental letter "n", however due to Sandhi rules, when the affix "vat" is added the dental letter "n" MUST be changed to the cerebral letter "ṇ" giving the word "akṣaṇvat". But in fact the word was not printed "in full" on the printed page. So the "error" has officially occurred only in MW online where headwords are spelled out in full, and this of course requires proper Sandhi rule application. I still consider this Supplement from the annexure: "akṣan-vat see akṣaṇ-vat. [ID=670.1 sup]" TO BE Confusing, misleading and not helpful; therefore I would simply ommitt it from MW online and mark as a "print change"; THAT reminds of role call, where the (mūḍha) teacher says, "Please raise your hand if your are not present!"

Please consider this, you cannot have the NAME "vindhyavāsin" without it bearing direct relation to the EXISTING Headword of that same title. For example, if someone has the name "Idiot", it will be very difficult to convince other people that he is not an Idiot (having such a name). ALSO, I would recommend relocating the Supplementary definition in the Window Display of the Headword "vindhyavāsin" to BELOW the Main Entry Definition. In my view, a Supplementary "Group" should not take precedence over the Main Entry Definition itself. As I have mentioned before, a "group" such as this is simply Happenstance. The fact of "vindhyavāsin" being the N. of a Sāṃkhya teacher is not "antaraṅga" (metaphorically speaking) to the Sanskrit Language itself.

 LB ———The original Main Entry for the Headword "vijā́man” prints: "vi-jā́man mfn. related i.e. corresponding to each other, symmetrical, RV.; AV.; ŚBr."
 LB ———THEN, the Revision itself needs to be reconsidered as the annexure prints as follows: "vi-jā́man (read, ‘corresponding to each other,’ i.e. ‘being in pairs,’ ‘symmetrical’)." NOW COMPARE THAT with the currently existing Revision ONLINE (which remember has been 'pinned' to the wrong headword at the wrong location, because the correct Headword is absent from the Hierarchy List as explained above).
 LB ———vi-°jā́man (read ‘corresponding to each other’, i.e. ‘being in pairs’, ‘symmetrical’) [ID=193039.1 rev (1332,2)]
 LB ———As you can see, the above quoted Revision has NOT been properly implemented.
 LB ———The FINAL CORRECT REVISION SHOULD READ: "vi-jā́man mfn. corresponding to each other, i.e. being in pairs, symmetrical, RV.; AV.; ŚBr."
 LB ———Also, Please note that the added quotation marks, such as seen here: ‘corresponding to each other’ ARE NOT NEEDED in the actual implementation of the Revision. They simply serve the purpose of INDICATING the content of the Revision to be implemented.

new = The supplemental insertion of this Headword should be placed just after the word "vācaṃyamatva [ID=190150]" in the Hierarchical listing of words, according to Alphabetic order. As I have stated before: "The anusvāra first precedes the semivowels, then the sibilants, then the letter h, and lastly the consonants beginning with k." A simple way to understand this reasoning is as follows: the Proper Anusvāra comes after the vowels and before the consonants according to the Standard Alphabetical Ordering of letters. However, the anusvāra preceding the consonants is accepted as the "Nasal" of that particular class of consonants; and that "Nasal" whichever it is, always FOLLOWS the proper Anusvāra in Alphabetical Order. However, the Anusvāra preceding the semivowels, sibilants and letter h, NEVER changes to a nasal, but always remains an anusvāra and therefore always comes first (before any nasal letter) in proper Alphabetical order.

The reason for this is that the compounds beginning with "vasty [ID=189227]" are STILL finishing out the compounds for 3. vasti; the change of "vasti" to "vasty" simply being an "antaraṅga" Sandhi Rule. Therefore, these final compounds are part of the "grouping" of the compounds for 3. vasti, and this "grouping" cannot be violated by Alphabetical order as per Jim's mentioning of the "contest" between "group order" and "alphabertical order", whereby "group order" wins!

Therefore, in my own dictionary, I place the masculine from first (which is yathāpramāṇam); and then following this masculine form and sharing the same "prātipadika", I include the feminine form as given in the main entry; in this way everything is "neat and tidy" (rather than having the masculine and feminine forms dispersed in separate locations as if unrelated, as is currently the case).

 LB 1) is this meant to be in the "plural number"?
 LB 2) is the first definition meant to be a translation of the name of this particular class of Buddhist deities? So that the FULL sense to be understood is:  "a class of Buddhist deities of whom none is the youngest"?

comment = Typo – Please note that this is a possible Headword Typo and Print Change. Here is the reasoning: 1) Both APTE and the Great Vācaspatyam derive this word as "ajura" with the affix KuraC (where K and C are elided). Please consult the Pāṇini rule 3.2.162. Similarly derived words are: vidura, bhidura, chidura. Note that all end in the vowel "a", which of course is part of the KuraC affix. I hope that Andhrabharati will comment.

Please note that the general rule in MW dictionary is that words ending in the feminine "tā" are located alphabetically along with all of the proper compounds. Whereas the forms ending in the affix "ka" ALWAYS come after all of the proper compounds. You may confirm this by checking the placement of the following two Headwords: 1) "śūnyatā f. [ID=220093]"  AND   "śūnyaka mfn. [ID=220127]"; as you can see (just from the ID numbers) this proves the point. Therefore, über-Kaching!
