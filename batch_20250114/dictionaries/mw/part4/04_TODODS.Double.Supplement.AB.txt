TODODS Double Supplement
TODODSy problem solved by previous work. NO CHANGE at this time
=============================

* TODODSy Case 15: 11/03/2024 dict=MW, L=5645.2, hw=anālabdha, user=srhodes
old = Double Supplement
new = Words which have two supplementary definitions are somewhat common. I suggest for Jim to "force" a single "circle-S" Supplemental Insertion Symbol to the right side of this word in the Hierarchy List Display. There is no need for the Double "S S" – One supplemental indicator is sufficient for the job.
comment = Double Supplement
status = PENDING

**Jim comment
simple-search currently shows one circle-S.  NO CHANGE

* TODODSy Case 40: 11/04/2024 dict=MW, L=4663.1, hw=adhyāśaya, user=srhodes
old = Double Supplement
new = Words which have two supplementary definitions are somewhat common. I suggest for Jim to "force" a single "circle-S" Supplemental Insertion Symbol to the right side of this word in the Hierarchy List Display. There is no need for the Double "S S" – One supplemental indicator is sufficient for the job. Actually, it is interesting to note that this is a "Triple Supplementary Listing" – I wonder why we don't see THREE "circle-S" symbols?
