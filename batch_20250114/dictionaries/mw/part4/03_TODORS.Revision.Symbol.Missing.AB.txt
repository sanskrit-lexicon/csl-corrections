old = Revision Symbol Missing
new = Please add the "circle-R" Revision Symbol to the right side of this word in the Hierarchy List Display. Also, I am wondering how this instance "escaped" from Jim's automated correction to this issue? If you can enlighten me, then for you it is a (kaching!)

**AB comment:
Jim had earlier worked out to "resolve" some of such cases. I had replied to his post mentioning about other cases there itself.
Jim to look again for the short-comings in his "algorithm"!

 metalines for anAgAmin

<L>5460<pc>27,3<k1>anAgAmin<k2>an-AgAmin<e>2B <info n="rev" pc="1311,2"/>

simple-search list  no circle-R
solution: add <listinfo n="rev"/> to first one L=5458
Now circle-R shows in simple-search list. Done

* TODORSy Case 22: 11/03/2024 dict=MW, L=5370.2, hw=anavṛtta, user=srhodes
old = Revision NOT Supplement
new = Please DELETE this Headword: "anavṛtta [ID=5370.2 sup]". It is merely a REVISION Instruction that has already been carried out as per the instructiong: " (p. 28, col. 3), read an-āvṛtta." Now, two things remain to be done: 1) Mark the Headword "anāvṛtta [ID=5664]" as a REVISION with the "circle-R" symbol; 2) Give Scott a round of applause.
comment = Revision NOT Supplement
status = PENDING

**AB comment:
This revision is applied to L-5664; however the tag <info n="rev"/> is missing there & this "sup" entry remained in the CDSL text.
And, I recall handful of such cases that I had corrected in my version, changing the "sup" cases to "rev" cases and vice-versa!
My version contains it thus (L-5664)--
(0028,3)	⓶❁<s2>án-āvṛtta</s2>,	 🠚✦ 〔mfn.〕	 🠚⧫¦ not turned about or round;⫽rev(1311,2);
[It shows the way I had changed the notations and formatting at my end, containing all the necessary info together.]

* TODORSy Case 24: 11/03/2024 dict=MW, L=5238.1, hw=anarman, user=srhodes
old = Supplement or Revision?
new = Please RECONSIDER: The Main Entry reads: "anarman mfn. = an-arvan, q.v., AV. vii, 7, 1." THEN IN THE SUPPLEMENT (OR REVISION), we read: "w.r. for an-arvan, AV. vii, 7, 1." Please NOTICE that the SOURCE cited as well as the DEFINITION given in both cases are IDENTICAL, with one IMPORTANT difference: In the main entry we read: "= an-arvan" and in the Revision(?) we read: "w.r. for an-arvan". It appears that the SECOND statement OVERRULES (or revises) the FIRST statement. The contest is: 1) "="  VERSUS  2) "w.r.". (kaching!)
comment = Supplement or Revision?
status = PENDING

**AB comment:
This is what my version contains--
(0026,2): अनर्मन्	⓵❁<s1>anarmán</s1>,	 🠚✦ 〔mfn.〕	 🠚⧫¦ ⁅w. r.⁆ for ✾<si>an-arván</si>, <ls>AV. vii, 7, 1</ls>.⫽rev(1311,1);
[It shows the way I had changed the notations and formatting at my end, containing all the necessary info together.]
And, this is one of the cases that I had just mentioned above (Case 22).

**Jim comment.  
There are two consecutive entries under anarman
<L>5238<pc>26,2<k1>anarman<k2>anarma/n<e>1  <info n="rev" pc="1311,1"/>
<L>5238.2<pc>1311,1<k1>anarman<k2>a-narman<e>1  <info n="sup"/>

simple-search display shows anarman twice:
anarman R 
anarman S

CONCLUDE: NO further CHANGE

ALSO, please relocate the position of this (masculine gender) Supplemental Definition within the Display Window so as to follow the Main Entry Definition given for the Masculine Gender: "m. a neighbouring rival, a rival neighbour [ID=4993]". (kaching!)

**AB comment:
I had properly placed this at L-4993.1 (sans any text preceding the broken-bar) in my version & Jim may do the needful at the CDSL end.
(1311,1)	 ⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯	 ⇨✦	 ⇨⧫¦ the next (younger) brother after (⁅abl.⁆), <ls>MBh.</ls>;⫽add(1311,1);
[It shows the way I had changed the notations and formatting at my end, containing all the necessary info together.]

**Jim comment: 'anantara' has 11 consecutive entries, first L=4986, last = 4995.
L 4993.1  has <info n="sup"/>
 [All <e>1, <e>1A, or <e>1B  -  4993.1 is 1B]
simple-search list panel: NO CIRCLE-S !
Try:  add <listinfo n="sup"/> to L=4986
Now simple-search list panel has CIRCLE-S Hurray!

This is one of the cases that I had mentioned above (Case 22).

old = Supplement NOT Revision!
new = Supplement! (kaching!)
comment = Supplement NOT Revision!
status = PENDING

**AB comment:
This is an insertion into the text at same meaning sense & not an additional meaning; as such this is to be treated as a "rev" [insert/ delete/ modify], the "sup" tag having been allotted to additional entry words or additional meaning senses
Nothing to be done here.
**Jim comment:
 <L>4020<pc>20,1<k1>aDarmAstikAya<k2>aDarmAstikAya<e>3 <info n="sup"/>
 change to <info n="rev"/> based on AB comment
simple-search now shows circle-R
