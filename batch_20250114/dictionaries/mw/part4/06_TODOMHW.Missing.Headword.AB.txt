* TODOMHWy Case 58: 11/05/2024 dict=MW, L=4112.1, hw=adhastānnābhi, user=srhodes
old = Missing Headword
new = You might consider adding the following Headword from the Supplemental Section: "adhastān (in comp. for adhastāt)". Of course it is placed just prior to "adhastānnābhi", and probably with a single indentation to match the Headword "adhastāt".

**AB comment:
I have this and few more such entries from the Annexure, as Comp. group Header in my version--
	<L>4113.05<pc>1310,2<k1>adhastān<k2>adhastān<e>2
	<s>adhastān</s> ¦ (in <ab>comp.</ab> for <s>°stāt</s>);
	<LEND><info n="sup"/>
**Jim comment:
The suppl. entry is an advice to reader regarding placement
of  the suppl. compounds aDastAnnABi, aDastAnnirbADam.
aDastAt and its two compounds on page 20,2 are
  <L>4111<pc>20,2<k1>aDastAt<k2>aDa/stAt<e>2
  <L>4112<pc>20,2<k1>aDastAddiS<k2>aDastAd-diS<e>3
  <L>4113<pc>20,2<k1>aDastAllakzman<k2>aDa/stAl-lakzman<e>3

CDSL has placed the two 'n' compounds from supplement 
  in alphabetically proper place
  <L>4112.1<pc>1310,2<k1>aDastAnnABi<k2>aDastAn—nABi<e>3
  <L>4112.2<pc>1310,2<k1>aDastAnnirbADam<k2>aDastAn—nirbADam<e>3
In all the compounds, the final 't' of aDastAt is changed
  by sandhi according to the para-pada.
Thus the suppl. entry 'aDastAn' has served its purpose
and is not needed as a separate entry.
Conclude: NO CHANGE

* TODOMHWy Case 120: 11/10/2024 dict=MW, L=1137.1, hw=agnihotra, user=srhodes
old = Missing Headword
new = I am suggesting to add the Headword "agnihotrī" to the Hierarchy list. Also, please note these considerations: 
  1) Two Supplemental Compounds follow the Headword "agnihotra"; 
  2) therefore perhaps the Headword "agnihotrī" should follow these two compounds:
     "agnihotraprāyaṇa and agnihotravelā" since the pūrvapada of these two compounds
     is "agnihotra" itself; 
  3) So after these two compounds, there will come the Headword "agnihotrī"; 
  4) and then the compound "agnihotrīvatsa" will naturally follow its correct "pūrvapada" namely "agnihotrī".
comment = Missing Headword
status = PENDING

**AB comment:
The entry "agnihotrī" is very much present in the Hierarchy list at present. This is the feminine form of the HW 1. agnihotra  (masc.).
The comp. words formed from the HW are always listed after all the lexical family words (m.. f. n. mfn. ind. and adv.) as a NORM in the MW dictionary. 
As such, no such shifting of "agnihotrī" is needed. 
Even otherwise, the said Annexure comp. entries duly belong to 2. agnihotra 
that follows agnihotrī (which is under 1. agnihotra).

**Jim comment.  Nice explanation from AB. NO CHANGE

* TODOMHWy Case 176: 11/12/2024 dict=MW, L=284, hw=akutas, user=srhodes
old = Missing Headword
new = Please note that the annexure gives the word: "akutaś (in comp. for a-kutas)". I know that this is extremely minor, but you may choose to add to the Hiearchy List between the Headword "akutas" and the following compounds.

**AB comment:
I have this and few more such entries from the Annexure, as Comp. group Header in my version--
	<L>284.05<pc>1308,1<k1>akutaś<k2>a-kutaś<e>2
	<s>a-kutaś</s> ¦ (in <ab>comp.</ab> for <s>a-kutas</s>).
	<LEND>
**Jim comment:  NO CHANGE.  My argument is analogous to that of 
  Case 58 above.

* TODOMHWy Casey 179: 11/12/2024 dict=MW, L=124, hw=aṃhomuc, user=srhodes
old = Missing Headword
new = Please add the Headword "aṃho (in comp. for aṃhas)". This follows the annexure printed text, and it is a nice touch prior to the following compounds.

* TODOMHWx Case 300: 11/22/2024 dict=MW, L=264421, hw=heṣa, user=srhodes
old = Missing Headword
new = I am suggesting to ADD the Headword "heṣakratu" as suggested here. The citation: "RV. iii, 26, 5." uses this very word and therefore it should be added to MW online (rather than lay buried under its pūrvapada). As I sidenote, in my own dictionary, I have split the Headword "heṣa" AND "heṣakratu", into a "1" and "2", and listing each case under each respective root "√heṣ 1 and 2" with the appropriate definitions offered and also hinted by APTE.
comment = Missing Headword
status = PENDING

**AB comment:
The "heṣá-kratu" is a parenthetical word, and Jim had made about 2300 such words as separate entries (but skipped a lot many).
I have removed all such as entry words, for my logic of handling them is different.
Even Jim also expressed a view recently, that he had erred in listing them separately with a tag "info phwparent"!!

**Jim comment
 As an experiment, add this entry using {{LBody=NNN}} 
 Place immediately after the 'parent' heza
 heza is H2, set hezakratu as H3 (since heza is pUrvapada)
<L>264421.1<pc>1305,2<k1>hezakratu<k2>heza-kratu<e>3
{{Lbody=264421}}
<LEND>

The Lbody tag directs the xml 'body' of 264421.1 to
 be a copy the xml 'body'  of 264421. 

The parenthetical headwords could be changed to use Lbody
Example:
old:
--- the parent record points to child
<L>823<pc>4,3<k1>agasti<k2>aga/sti<e>1A
¦ <bot>Agasti Grandiflora</bot>, <ls>Suśr.</ls> [also <s>-dru</s> <lex type="phw">f.</lex>, <ls>L.</ls>]<info phwchild="825.1"/><info lex="inh"/>
<LEND

--- the child record points to parent
--- contains a fragment of the parent :  this is often tricky.
<L>825.1<pc>4,3<k1>agastidru<k2>aga/sti—dru<e>3
<s>aga/sti—dru</s> ¦ <lex>f.</lex>, <ls>L.</ls><info phwparent="823,agasti"/><info lex="f"/>
<LEND>
====================
new: parent removes pointer to child
<L>823<pc>4,3<k1>agasti<k2>aga/sti<e>1A
¦ <bot>Agasti Grandiflora</bot>, <ls>Suśr.</ls> [also <s>-dru</s> <lex type="phw">f.</lex>, <ls>L.</ls>]<info lex="inh"/>
<LEND

--- the child refers to parent, removes <info phwparent="823,agasti"/>
<L>825.1<pc>4,3<k1>agastidru<k2>aga/sti—dru<e>3
{{Lbody=823}}
<LEND>
