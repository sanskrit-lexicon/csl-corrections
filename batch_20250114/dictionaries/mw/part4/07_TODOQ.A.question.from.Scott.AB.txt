* TODOQy Case 43: 11/04/2024 dict=MW, L=4615.1, hw=adhyavasāya, user=srhodes
old = See Below
new = I mention this as a point of interest: 
 for my own purposes I have split the word "adhyavasāya" into 
 "adhyavasāya 1"  and  "adhyavasāya 2". 
 In fact, "adhyavasāya 2" is correctly the absolute (indeclinable)
    meaning "having decided" (among other things). 
 Now, even more interesting is this: 
 Does this Supplemental Definition IN FACT belong to the
  absolute (indeclinable) form that I have just mentioned? I say, "Yes". 
 There is no gender given and the definition matches to the accepted format 
 for the absolute form: "clinging to (earthly things), Divyāv. [ID=4615.1 sup]". 
 Also I derive this absolute form from the double prefixed root 
 "adhi-ava-√so" which in fact has "grapple with" as one of the possible 
 definitions. 
 "grappling with" and "clinging to" are close enough to link all this together 
 as belonging to the absolute (indeclinable) form as I am suggesting. 
 Shall I start my own "MW Dictionary Sanskrit Daily" 
 column in the Cologne University Newspaper?

  for discussions about interesting points of Sanskrit Dictionaries.

**AB comment:
Nothing to do here.

* TODOQx Case 139: 11/10/2024 dict=MW, L=988.2, hw=agnipānīya, user=srhodes
old = See Below
new = Here is a question:  What should should be understood here by the use of the word: "Hāla"?
comment = See Above
status = PENDING

**AB comment:
"Hāla" is the way his work Gāhāsattasaī (Gāthāsaptaśatī), a compilation of 700 Prākṛit verses is referred to. And the Sch. is referring to the commentary on it (in Sanskrit) by Bhuvanapāla.

A side-note to Jim:
This indicates some missing <ls> tags in the CDSL text. I have places where this is tagged.
Probably another round of relooking at the whole of MW text may be needed to identify such missings.
Are you game?

**Jim comment
1. "<s1>Hāla</s1>"  ->  "<ls>Hāla</ls>
2. in csl-pywork repo, add line to tooltip.txt
   94.01	Hāla	 Gāthāsaptaśatī [Cologne Addition]	Title
3. I like the idea of reviewing MW for missing ls tags 
   The tooltip.txt file for MW are 8 items with '?' and 268
   '[Cologne Addition]' items that should be reviewed.
   HOWEVER, I do not commit to doing this. As you know,
   I intend to greatly diminish my contribution to the cdsl project.
   You have many good ideas for improvments to the cdsl project.
   You might try to itemize these for working with Dhaval.

old = utinam! 
new = ?
comment = Typo – Please note that I am uncertain as to what this means: "utinam! " ; Please comment?
status = PENDING

**AB comment:
Scott seems to be looking at every word keenly!
Be noted that 'utinam' is a german word, which MW has wrongly carried into his dictionary in addition to its meaning ("would that") [लिङ् (Potential)] from the PWG which has "am Anf. des Satzes mit folg. potent. <i>ach wenn doch, utinam (?)</i>: <s>utādhīyīta</s> P. 3,3,152, Sch." under the "uta" entry.

**AB comment:
Glad that someone else has noted this, apart from me!
There are 91 places  where such marking  (number in parenthesis is seen in the whole MW text, involving the numbers 2 to 7) after the HW (all except at one place).
I had marked them as cases (vibhakti), indicates the Tatpuruṣa compunds of that particular case.
The counts are as below--
<cse>2</cse> : 6, <cse>3</cse> : 27, <cse>4</cse> : 39, <cse>5</cse> : 11, <cse>6</cse> : 7 & <cse>7</cse> : 2
[I did a full exercise those days (about 5 years ago) to "mark" every number in some appropriate way in my version of MW text.]

**Jim comment:  looks straightforward
  to add markup (and displays could add a tooltip). "cse" is a new tag
  which can be added to one.dtd
  This would be a good one to start your collaboration with Dhaval

* TODOQx Case 322: 11/25/2024 dict=MW, L=155, hw=akaniṣṭha, user=srhodes
old = See below
new = I have two question regarding the second definition: "a class of Buddhist deities."
 LB 1) is this meant to be in the "plural number"?
 LB 2) is the first definition meant to be a translation of the name of this particular class of Buddhist deities? So that the FULL sense to be understood is:  "a class of Buddhist deities of whom none is the youngest"?
comment = See above
status = PENDING

**AB comment:
A1. The definition ("deities") itself indicates plurality; so why this question?
A2. The first meaning (from Ṛgveda) & second meaning (from Burnoufʼs Introduction to the history of Indian Buddhism) are not related in any manner.

BTW, MW has erred in marking the lexical category for these two! The 1st one should be adj. (mfn.) and the 2nd one m. pl.
[Refer to the parent PWG for this; and the pwk has marked the first meaning also as adj. pl., wherein pl. is to be deleted. Jim to do the needful pl.]

**Jim comment  two print changes

** pc: 155 : akanizWa : : <lex>m. <ab>pl.</ab></lex>  : add gender

new = Please Clarify – Is this Headword actually different and unrelated by derivation to the Locative Singular form of the word "karman"? OR is this a "locative" usage, giving it this contextual meaning?

* TODOQx Case 948: 01/10/2025 dict=MW, L=5383, hw=anaśnantsāṅgamana, user=srhodes
old = án-aśnan-t-sāṅgamaná 
new = ?
comment = Typo – I am wondering about the correct final form of this Headword. It obviously contains the word "aśnat" with the nominative form being "aśnan", but in this compound should it be written as: "anaśnatsāṅgamana) ?  What is the purpose of the parsing: "n-t-s" ? Does this mean that the letter "n" becomes "t" due to internal sandhi within the compound? Please confirm or explain accordingly.
status = PENDING

**AB comment:
I would suggest to add another hyphen before this 'n' at n-t-s, as it indicates the addl. 'n' in Vedic Sanskrit (such as in vant ->vat & mant ->mat etc.) which got discarded in later Sanskrit. [There were quite a few discussions about this point by the 19th century Indologists.]
The word is anaśnant-sāṅgamana = anaśna(n)t-sāṅgamana = anaśnat-sāṅgamana, thus listed as a comp. word under "anaśnat"! Goldstücker gives the etymology of this word in 1856. The PWG had this inside the body matter (under "anaśnat"), which got elevated to a HW level in GST, MW & PD.

Jim comment:
Adjust k2 field of metaline:
old:
<L>5383<pc>27,2<k1>anaSnantsANgamana<k2>a/n-aSnan-t-sANgamana/<e>3

old = Nāch-girl
new = ?
comment = Typo – Please explain the term: "Nāch-girl"; specifically what does "Nāch" mean? 
status = PENDING

**AB comment:
'Nāch' is a Hindi word, meaning "dance"; and 'Nāch-girl' means "dancing-girl". It is duly tagged as a <ns> (non-Sanskrit) term.
