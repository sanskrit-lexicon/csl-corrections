comment = Typo – Please note that this is a possible "print change", pending confirmation by Jim or Andhrabharati. The form "vinakti" resembles the class 7 root √vic; also it is referenced here: "(cf. √vic)". The form "vinakti" would be a strange class one finite verbal form given the root √vij.

Case 953: 01/11/2025 dict=MW, L=5498.1, hw=anātmatā, user=srhodes
old = Placement Error
new = The supplemental insertion of this Headword should be placed just after the word "anātmajña mfn. [ID=5494]" in the Hierarchical listing of words. Please note that the general rule in MW dictionary is that words ending in the feminine "tā" are located alphabetically along with all of the proper compounds. Whereas the forms ending in the affix "ka" ALWAYS come after all of the proper compounds. You may confirm this by checking the placement of the following two Headwords: 1) "śūnyatā f. [ID=220093]"  AND   "śūnyaka mfn. [ID=220127]"; as you can see (just from the ID numbers) this proves the point. Therefore, über-Kaching!

comment = Typo – I am wondering about the correct final form of this Headword. It obviously contains the word "aśnat" with the nominative form being "aśnan", but in this compound should it be written as: "anaśnatsāṅgamana) ?  What is the purpose of the parsing: "n-t-s" ? Does this mean that the letter "n" becomes "t" due to internal sandhi within the compound? Please confirm or explain accordingly.

As I have stated before: "The anusvāra first precedes the semivowels, then the sibilants, then the letter h, and lastly the consonants beginning with k." A simple way to understand this reasoning is as follows: the Proper Anusvāra comes after the vowels and before the consonants according to the Standard Alphabetical Ordering of letters. However, the anusvāra preceding the consonants is accepted as the "Nasal" of that particular class of consonants; and that "Nasal" whichever it is, always FOLLOWS the proper Anusvāra in Alphabetical Order. However, the Anusvāra preceding the semivowels, sibilants and letter h, NEVER changes to a nasal, but always remains an anusvāra and therefore always comes first (before any nasal letter) in proper Alphabetical order.

ALSO, I would recommend relocating the Supplementary definition in the Window Display of the Headword "vindhyavāsin" to BELOW the Main Entry Definition. In my view, a Supplementary "Group" should not take precedence over the Main Entry Definition itself. As I have mentioned before, a "group" such as this is simply Happenstance. The fact of "vindhyavāsin" being the N. of a Sāṃkhya teacher is not "antaraṅga" (metaphorically speaking) to the Sanskrit Language itself. Therefore the Main Entry Definition which derives "antaraṅga" from the Sanskrit Language itself deserves precedence to this "Happenstance" grouping from the annexure.

The reason for this is because at this location we have words listed where the initial portion "sva" is a result of Sandhi: the prefix "su" followed by the vowel "a". And this analysis matches the Headword "sv-avokṣita mfn. well sprinkled", as can clearly be seen. BUT, the current location of the Headword "sv-avokṣita" is in the midst of compounds formed from the pūrvapada "sva" as "sva—vairitā" and "sva-śakti". (kaching!)

But in fact the word was not printed "in full" on the printed page. So the "error" has officially occurred only in MW online where headwords are spelled out in full, and this of course requires proper Sandhi rule application.

Aṅkura” which itself has been correctly added to the Main Entry. What is to be done here? LB —I propose that "1. Aṅkura" be marked as a "print change" and left exactly as it is, of course with the deletion of the "circle-R" Symbol. LB ——This also touches on another point raised recently by Andhrabharati regarding “compound” headings in the annexure. This is my view on the matter:  In cases like "aṅkura", since the Headword already exists in the Main Entry, there is no need to add the additional “aṅkura” from the annexure that precedes the Supplemental compounds, because this will be obious from the proper placement after the existing Headword “Aṅkura” in the Main Entry. In such cases, the “Aṅkura’” heading in the annexure is ONLY serving the purpose of indicating the “pūrvapada” for the following supplementary compounds, but this is already obvious in the Main Entry by the very fact of the Existing Headword “Aṅkura”. I suggest that we ONLY add the “pūvapada” Compound Headword from the annexure into the Main Entry in cases where it simply does not already exist, which of course is less common, but then such a Supplementary Insertion into the Main Entry will be required to make clear the “pūrvapada” Compound Headword and following compounds which will all be inserted from the annexure into the Main Entry and marked accordingly.

As Andhrabharati has noted, "Scott likes to check other dictionaries: Apte, Shabda etc." I check other dictionaries because for my own dictionary I am integrating all information from all reliable sources. The word "aṅgulisaṃdeśa" which has been revised by Monier-Williams is spelled by Apte and Shabda as "aṅgulisandeśa". If we look up the word "saṃdeśa or sandeśa" and then "integrate" the meaning of the compound "aṅgulisaṃdeśa", we will find that this is a LEGITIMATE word in the Sanskrit Language and should NOT be cancelled! In fact I am shocked at the audacity of Monier-Williams! I have heard it said that in the Sanskrit Language there exist Two Million manuscripts that predate the printing press, whereas in the Greek Language the number is a mere twenty thousand. I would like to meet someone who has read all two million manuscripts! Therefore, speaking metaphorically, I take the entire Sanskrit Language as "ākṛtigaṇa" and I do not "close the door" on any possible (and legitimate) word. In fact the masters of language are allowed to 'coin' words (even at times in violation of the rules of grammar). All this being said, for my own dictionary I include both words "aṅgulisaṃdaṃśa" AND "aṅgulisandeśa or aṅgulisaṁdeśa" with a slight variation in meaning according to the "uttarapada" (in each case).

In fact, "adhyavasāya 2" is correctly the absolute (indeclinable) meaning "having decided" (among other things). Now, even more interesting is this: Does this Supplemental Definition IN FACT belong to the absolute (indeclinable) form that I have just mentioned? I say, "Yes". There is no gender given and the definition matches to the accepted format for the absolute form: "clinging to (earthly things), Divyāv. [ID=4615.1 sup]". Also I derive this absolute form form the double prefixed root "adhi-ava-√so" which in fact has "grapple with" as one of the possible definitions. "grappling with" and "clinging to" are close enough to link all this together as belonging to the absolute (indeclinable) form as I am suggesting.

As you will see, currently, the Headword "adhyetṛ  [ID=4511]" COMES BETWEEN the Doubly Listed Headword "adhyeya". So, I am recommending three things to be done: 1) Be sure that the two Headwords "adhyeya" (listed twice) follow each other without interruption by the Headword "adhyetṛ";  2) You may even consider to eliminate the Double Listing of the Headword "adhyeya" since it is actually one and the SAME word deriving from "adhi-√i", simply with the addition of a Supplemental Definition;  3) I also suggest specifically marking this now singular occurence of "adhyeya" as "adhyeya 1" (with the number 1 in the Hierarchy Display) so as to distinguish it from the Homonym "adhyeya 2" which is parsed beginning with the negative particle "a".

Case 18: 11/03/2024 dict=MW, L=5561.1, hw=anāprīta, user=srhodes
old = Double Supplement
new = Words which have two supplementary definitions are somewhat common. I suggest for Jim to "force" a single "circle-S" Supplemental Insertion Symbol to the right side of this word in the Hierarchy List Display. There is no need for the Double "S S" – One supplemental indicator is sufficient for the job.

Case 14: 11/03/2024 dict=MW, L=5684.1, hw=anāśvāsika, user=srhodes
old = Placement Error
new = The supplemental insertion of this Headword should be placed (without indentation) just before the word "anāṣṭra [ID=5704]" in the Hierarchical listing of words. The reasoning is as follows:  All of the compounds listed here under the Headword "anāśaka  [ID=5680]" derive from the verbal root: "2. aś [ID=19416]" (with the negative particle "an" as the initial prefix). However, the supplemental word under discussion: "anāśvāsika mfn. [ID=5684.1 sup]" derives from the prefixed root "ā-√śvas" with the negative particle "an" as the initial prefix. Therefore, the Etymology is entirely different; thus the relocation is necessary to please Pāṇini, Jim, Andhrabharati and Scott. (kaching!)

Case 13: 11/03/2024 dict=MW, L=5707.4, hw=anāstha, user=srhodes
old = Placement Error
new = The supplemental insertion of this Headword should be placed just before the word "anāsthā [ID=5714]" in the Hierarchical listing of words. You may also choose to further "link" these two words since "anāsthā" is the feminine form, while "anāstha" is the adjective.

Case 11: 11/03/2024 dict=MW, L=5890.1, hw=anirvartin, user=srhodes
old = Main Entry Missing?
new = The problem here is the word: "(also)" given in the Supplemental Definition: "(also) unalterable, MBh." The word "(also)" requires a Main Entry Definition to which this Supplementary Definition will be added. However No Main Entry is found for this word: "anirvartin". Attention Andhrabharati, We need your wise counsel!
