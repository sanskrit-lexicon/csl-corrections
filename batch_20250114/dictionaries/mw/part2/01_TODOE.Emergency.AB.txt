* TODOE Case 280: 11/19/2024 dict=MW, L=156526, hw=madhyamapadalopa, user=srhodes
old = sākapriya
new = śāka-priya
comment = Typo & EMERGENCY • The Typo is corrected above • The Emergency is: "This is NOT a Revision!"; This definition is Strictly from the Main Entry and there is No Mention of this in the annexure! Please REMOVE the "circle-R" Revision Symbol from the Hierarchy List (and no revision in the window display) • (Super-kaching!)
status = NO CHANGE

AB comment:
The revision mentioned in Annexure is for "number -> member".
In the "sāka-priya-pārthiva" (as in p. 782) the hyphen at the line ending is required to be retained, which clearly indicates the "madhyama-pada" (middle-word)!

Jim comment:  As I understand it, no change is required here acc. to AB.
