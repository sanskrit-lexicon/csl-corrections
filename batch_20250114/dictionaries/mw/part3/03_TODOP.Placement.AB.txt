* TODOPx Case 13: 11/03/2024 dict=MW, L=5707.4, hw=anāstha, user=srhodes
old = Placement Error
new = The supplemental insertion of this Headword should be placed just before the word "anāsthā [ID=5714]" in the Hierarchical listing of words. You may also choose to further "link" these two words since "anāsthā" is the feminine form, while "anāstha" is the adjective.

* TODOPy Case 14: 11/03/2024 dict=MW, L=5684.1, hw=anāśvāsika, user=srhodes
old = Placement Error
new = The supplemental insertion of this Headword should be placed (without indentation) just before the word "anāṣṭra [ID=5704]" in the Hierarchical listing of words. The reasoning is as follows:  All of the compounds listed here under the Headword "anāśaka  [ID=5680]" derive from the verbal root: "2. aś [ID=19416]" (with the negative particle "an" as the initial prefix). However, the supplemental word under discussion: "anāśvāsika mfn. [ID=5684.1 sup]" derives from the prefixed root "ā-√śvas" with the negative particle "an" as the initial prefix. Therefore, the Etymology is entirely different; thus the relocation is necessary to please Pāṇini, Jim, Andhrabharati and Scott. (kaching!)

old = Placement Error
new = This is a unique Revision in that the spelling of the Headword itself has been changed. Now, the spelling correction (which has already been accomplished) requires the corrected Headword to be "Relocated" to its proper Etymological location, which in this case is just after the word "amalātman [ID=13993]" in the Hierarchical listing of words. (kaching!)

Also, please note that the word "anadhīyāna" correctly follows the word "anadhīyat" in the Supplemental Section, and therefore when inserting both words into the Main Entry their relative position to each other cannot be reversed (especially since they are directly related)!

The CDSL convention at MW is to split to next line (L-number in case of substantives) at the semi-colon, when the meaning sense is changed.

old = Placement Error
new = The supplemental insertion of this Headword should be placed just before the word "svavyāja [ID=259466]" in the Hierarchical listing of words. The reason for this is because at this location we have words listed where the initial portion "sva" is a result of Sandhi: the prefix "su" followed by the vowel "a". And this analysis matches the Headword "sv-avokṣita mfn. well sprinkled", as can clearly be seen. BUT, the current location of the Headword "sv-avokṣita" is in the midst of compounds formed from the pūrvapada "sva" as "sva—vairitā" and "sva-śakti". (kaching!)

  (Ref: https://github.com/sanskrit-lexicon/csl-corrections/issues/104#issuecomment-3695578916)
"śalāluka" is a parenthetical word under "śalālu"; and as such it SHOULD be immediately after the parent entry, if at all it is separately listed as in CDSL text [my version does not list such words separately!].

new = The supplemental insertion of this Headword should be placed just after the word "vīta [ID=210346]" in the Hierarchical listing of words (and I believe with a single indentation).

If you like this idea, then you may follow my lead as stated in the first sentence above.

old = Placement Error
new = Please note that the PROOF of this placement correction is given in the very definition itself: "(fr. Desid. of √5. vas)". Therefore, please relocate this Headword accordingly. This also raises another point: "It would be very useful to be able to search words in MW online according to the ID number." Because, in this current case, it is laborious to locate "√5. vas", simply by scrolling through the Hierarchy. So, I leave the final placement up to you, but the general location is clearly under "√5. vas", of course with appropriate indentation.

new = It is possible that this Headword should be relocated to follow after "1. ví—deva [ID=193128]". What caught my eye here is the "similarity" in accent. For example, please compare: "ví-devam ind. [ID=196118.1 sup]"; and the Current Placement after the Headword: "2. vi-devá m. [ID=196118]" which bears a DIFFERENT accent altogether.

Therefore the placement of the Headword "vātaikabhakṣa" should follow STRICT alphabetical ordering, which currently has been violated in the Hierarchy List. By moving ONE SINGLE Headword everything gets resolved. Please Relocate the Headword: "vāteśvaratīrtha [ID=189654]" to Follow Immediately after the Headword "vātāhāra [ID=189652]". This correction Elegantly resolves two existing Alphabetical Errors. I have followed this ordering in my own dictionary. Is this considered "print change" since we are Relocating the Headword?

old = Placement Error
new = The supplemental insertion of this Headword should be placed just after the word "vācaṃyamatva [ID=190150]" in the Hierarchical listing of words, according to Alphabetic order. As I have stated before: "The anusvāra first precedes the semivowels, then the sibilants, then the letter h, and lastly the consonants beginning with k." A simple way to understand this reasoning is as follows: the Proper Anusvāra comes after the vowels and before the consonants according to the Standard Alphabetical Ordering of letters. However, the anusvāra preceding the consonants is accepted as the "Nasal" of that particular class of consonants; and that "Nasal" whichever it is, always FOLLOWS the proper Anusvāra in Alphabetical Order. However, the Anusvāra preceding the semivowels, sibilants and letter h, NEVER changes to a nasal, but always remains an anusvāra and therefore always comes first (before any nasal letter) in proper Alphabetical order.

old = Placement Error
new = The supplemental insertion of this Headword should be placed just after the word "vastyauṣadha [ID=189229]". The reason for this is that the compounds beginning with "vasty [ID=189227]" are STILL finishing out the compounds for 3. vasti; the change of "vasti" to "vasty" simply being an "antaraṅga" Sandhi Rule. Therefore, these final compounds are part of the "grouping" of the compounds for 3. vasti, and this "grouping" cannot be violated by Alphabetical order as per Jim's mentioning of the "contest" between "group order" and "alphabertical order", whereby "group order" wins!

new = The supplemental insertion of this Headword should be placed just before the word "2. vapana n. the act of sowing seed [ID=186306]". This correction makes follows the correct etymology which currently has been overlooked. The reason for this is clear if you compare the meaning of he word "vapatra m. a field" with the meaning of the word "1. vapana n. the act of shearing or shaving or cutting off [ID=186282]". Clearly this is the WRONG etymological placement. Therefore, the relocation as suggested above which follows the correct etymology: " vapatra m. a field" AND THEN "2. vapana n. the act of sowing seed [ID=186306]". This is another GREAT example of how I shave with "Occam's razor" – everything is simple, straightforward and clear, problem solved!

new = The supplemental insertion of this Headword should be placed just before the word "rākā f. [ID=176013]" in the Hierarchical listing of words. Now, I expect there may be some disagreement, but I am simply shaving with "Occam's razor". In other words, I take the one singular "prātipadika" to be "rāka" and from this we have the masculine form as given in the annexure, and the already existing feminine form listed in the main entry. Therefore, in my own dictionary, I place the masculine from first (which is yathāpramāṇam); and then following this masculine form and sharing the same "prātipadika", I include the feminine form as given in the main entry; in this way everything is "neat and tidy" (rather than having the masculine and feminine forms dispersed in separate locations as if unrelated, as is currently the case).

I also include the following (additional definition): 'receiving by means of the mouth', pl. N. of a partic. class of self-mortifying devotees. Since MW dictionary is considered an "Etymological Dictionary", therefore when locating words from the annexure to within the Main Entry, the Correct Etymology should be taken into account!

While Scott's analysis (& understanding) is appreciable, we should note that the Annexure clearly gives this word after "mukha-vāta" and also "mukhena" is not a "regular" entry par se (being a parenthetical word); as such, this suggested placement is unwarranted.
