old = vyavasāyātmika
new = vyavasāyātmaka
comment = Typo – I believe that this is a "print change". Please have Jim and Andhrabharati confirm this correction. The confusion occurs because the feminine form is "vyavasāyātmikā", however the actual prātipadikam form is "vyavasāyātmaka". Also notice the Etymology listed here: E. vyavasāya, ātman self, kan added. When the affix "kan" is added, the vowel "i" only comes in the feminine gender. Both APTE and MW dictionary list ""vyavasāyātmaka". Also, of course there is the word "ātmaka", and the correct feminine form will be "ātmikā"; but there is no such word as "ātmika".

old = Headword Listed Twice
new = Please DELETE the second redundant listing of this Headword in the Hierarchy. Of course there is the sense here of 1. aga and 2. aga, HOWEVER, they are NOT marked as such and a SINGLE search of the Headword "aga" is sufficient to BRING both definitions into view. Therefore a redundant listing in the hierarchy is simply REDUNDANT; is that a tautology? and should I offer an apology?
comment = Headword Listed Twice
status = NO CHANGE  Jim: In WIL (and hence YAT, SHS) most verbs are

comment = Typo – Please note that in my own dictionary I have chosen to use the word "ladybug". In any case, I suggest removing the "hyphen". Please note that we are absolutely NOT talking about a "bird", so why offer the confusion? The first definition states: "An insect of a scarlet color", (not a bird). I consider Sanskrit to be VERY exacting, so why introduce "confusion" in the English translation? May I say, "धिक् शब्दसागरे!"

old = Fire-arms
new = Firearms
comment = Typo – Please consider this as a Global Correction across all dictionaries. Of course, I understand that the hyphen is simply "parsing" the two words: "agni" and "astra", but the TRUTH is that the final word itself is NOT hyphenated in English. And honestly even a neophyte's brain should be able to "parse" the sense of this compound. Do as you like, but I take the fact of the English Translation to require Proper Use of the English Language.

Therefore, I completely agree with the use of the Hyphen. But when the Hyphen is NOT needed, I elide it by LOPA ELISION! (and then it is there if you need it to be).

old = fore part

comment = Typo – Please note that this is a suggested "print change" and could be considered as a Global Correction across all dictionaries with the following coding: " fore part " — becomes — " forepart " (the space in front and following will prevent ativyāpti in the search and replace function).

* TODOx Case 417: 12/05/2024 dict=SHS, L=342, hw=agrabhūmi, user=srhodes
old = mf.
new = m.f.
comment = Typo – Please note that this is a suggested "print change". This is the format that I use in my own dictionary. Of course, whatever "format" is chosen should be singular and without variation. So if it so happens that sometimes it is "mf." and sometimes it is "m.f.", then I consider this an error in nomenclature. Please consider this as a Global Correction across all dictionaries in order to establish a clear standard. "m" is an abbeviation and should have a "period" following. "f" is an abbreviation and should have a "period" following. "mf" is not a proper abbreviation, and therefore it should be corrected as stated here.
status = NO CHANGE  'mf.' is the standard used by SHS.

comment = Typo – Headword Typo • Kaching! • Also, please note that this typo is interesting because I have decided to incorporate it into my own Sanskrit Dictionary as follows: "(agrasura) m. the first god or deity." If someone says that such a word does not exist – I reply, "Oh have you read the two million Sanskrit Manuscripts that pre-date the printing press?" (in support of your negation).

old =  te 
new =  to 
comment = Typo – Please note that this should be considered as a Global Correction. If you make the correction target: " te " —becomes— : " to " ,  then this will avoid ativyāpti by isolating the two letters from being any portion of a word; hence the requirement of the single space pūrvottara (preceding and following).
