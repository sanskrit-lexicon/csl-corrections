old = Unasked
new = Unattached
comment = Typo – Please note that this is a= possible "print change". My opinion is that this dictionary must have been recited and a scribe with bad hearing wrote down the definitions accordingly. Otherwise, where do we get the definition, "unasked"? Jim or Andhrabharati, Please comment.

old = aor. aviṣat, avikṣat Gr.;
new = aor. aviṣat, avikṣata, Gr.;
comment = Typo – Please note that this is a very likely "print change". The aorist form "aviṣat" is Parasmaipada; while the aorist form "avikṣata" is Ātmanepada. Of course this needs confirmation by Jim or Andhrabharati.
status = PENDING

Case 989: 01/13/2025 dict=MW, L=5754, hw=anikṣu, user=srhodes
old = sugar-cane
new = sugarcane OR sugar cane
comment = Typo – Please consider this to be a Global Correction across all dictionaries. It is better without the "hyphen", one way or the other.
status = PENDING

Case 988: 01/13/2025 dict=AP90, L=1415, hw=nitya, user=srhodes
old = -datrimaḥ
new = -dattrimaḥ
comment = Typo – I am wondering if this correction would be the better choice based upon the Headword : "dattrima", which apparently NO ONE spells "datrima". Please comment, Jim and Andhrabharati.

old = cl. 1. P. vinakti
new = cl. 7. P. vinakti
comment = Typo – Please note that this is a possible "print change", pending confirmation by Jim or Andhrabharati. The form "vinakti" resembles the class 7 root √vic; also it is referenced here: "(cf. √vic)". The form "vinakti" would be a strange class one finite verbal form given the root √vij.

old = uncalledfor speaker
new = uncalled-for speaker
comment = Typo – Please note that here the "hyphen" is probably the better choice. Otherwise, for example, one may say, "That was uncalled for." When "uncalled-for" is used as a modifier as it is here, then the hyphenation appears to be better than printing: "uncalledfor".

old = Alphabetical Placement?
new = Please note that the Alphabetical Placement here is very strange. The preceding Headword is: "anāraṃbhaḥ [ID=1360]"  AND the subsequent Headword is: "anāraṃbhaṇa [ID=1362]". SO THE "anusvāra" BOTH precedes and follows the Headword: "anārabhya" which contains no anusvāra. How is this possible? Also, please note that MW dictionary does NOT follow this ordering of words.

new = The supplemental insertion of this Headword should be placed just after the word "anātmajña mfn. [ID=5494]" in the Hierarchical listing of words. Please note that the general rule in MW dictionary is that words ending in the feminine "tā" are located alphabetically along with all of the proper compounds. Whereas the forms ending in the affix "ka" ALWAYS come after all of the proper compounds. You may confirm this by checking the placement of the following two Headwords: 1) "śūnyatā f. [ID=220093]"  AND   "śūnyaka mfn. [ID=220127]"; as you can see (just from the ID numbers) this proves the point. Therefore, über-Kaching!

comment = Typo – I am wondering about the correct final form of this Headword. It obviously contains the word "aśnat" with the nominative form being "aśnan", but in this compound should it be written as: "anaśnatsāṅgamana) ?  What is the purpose of the parsing: "n-t-s" ? Does this mean that the letter "n" becomes "t" due to internal sandhi within the compound? Please confirm or explain accordingly.

comment = Typo – Please note that I disagree with including "page break information" in the middle of the online definition. This is completely distracting and worthless. Please delete "Page023-b+ 60" and all such cases Globally across all dictionaries. Remember, ONLINE has NO page break.

Should these dictionaries be disregarded because they are chock-full of errors? Of course not! LB The TRUTH is this: People do not like the SiddhāntaKaumudī because it is TOO difficult and TOO great. But a GREAT EGO favors itself and therefore seeks refuge in such trite criticism as: "SK gives many wrong forms." Andhrabharati, with all dues respect,  please consider the following verse: LB कौमुदी यदि कण्ठस्था वृथा भाष्ये परिश्रमः । LB कौमुदी यद्यकण्ठस्था वृथा भाष्ये परिश्रमः ।। LB Thus, the Importance of कौमुदी cannot be understated!

comment = Headword Listed Twice • ALSO, regarding this correction which occurs countless times, it is worth mentioning: 1) A Headword that is printed only ONCE in Devanāgarī script should likewise appear only ONCE as a Headword in the Hierarchy; 2) Any word that contains both a qualitative and a substantive definition does NOT automatically become worthy of a Double Listing in the Hierarchy. As an example consider: A) salty (quality) and B) salt (substantive) – these two definitions would be properly contained within a Single Headword in any given Lexical Hieararchy. And on a final note I consider this to be absolute: 1) quality always and absolutely precedes substantive in every category of existence, because frankly the Guṇas precede the physical manifestation. über-Kaching!

As I have stated before: "The anusvāra first precedes the semivowels, then the sibilants, then the letter h, and lastly the consonants beginning with k." A simple way to understand this reasoning is as follows: the Proper Anusvāra comes after the vowels and before the consonants according to the Standard Alphabetical Ordering of letters. However, the anusvāra preceding the consonants is accepted as the "Nasal" of that particular class of consonants; and that "Nasal" whichever it is, always FOLLOWS the proper Anusvāra in Alphabetical Order. However, the Anusvāra preceding the semivowels, sibilants and letter h, NEVER changes to a nasal, but always remains an anusvāra and therefore always comes first (before any nasal letter) in proper Alphabetical order.

new = There are TWO Headwords: 1) the first is correctly placed as “vi—jāman mfn. related, corresponding. [ID=193039]”; 2) the second is MISSING! This Missing Headword is different by accent and placement: “vijā́man”; this Headword is located on the printed page of the Main Entry immediately following the Headword: "vijāta mfn. [ID=194974]”. This MISSING Headword: “vijā́man” has its own placement separate and distinct from "vijāman mfn. [ID=193039]”. So Perhaps there needs to be some numbering as “1” and “2” added to these two words which differ by accent and placement. LB ———NOW, another point of consideration regards the REVISION which applies only to the Missing Headword “vijā́man” which is located on the printed page of the Main Entry immediately following the Headword: "vijāta mfn. [ID=194974]”. LB ———SO FIRST: This Missing Headword “vijā́man” needs to be ADDED to the Hierarchy List in MW online after the Headword: "vijāta mfn. [ID=194974]”.  LB ———The original Main Entry for the Headword "vijā́man” prints: "vi-jā́man mfn. related i.e. corresponding to each other, symmetrical, RV.; AV.; ŚBr." LB ———THEN, the Revision itself needs to be reconsidered as the annexure prints as follows: "vi-jā́man (read, ‘corresponding to each other,’ i.e. ‘being in pairs,’ ‘symmetrical’)." NOW COMPARE THAT with the currently existing Revision ONLINE (which remember has been 'pinned' to the wrong headword at the wrong location, because the correct Headword is absent from the Hierarchy List as explained above). LB ———vi-°jā́man (read ‘corresponding to each other’, i.e. ‘being in pairs’, ‘symmetrical’) [ID=193039.1 rev (1332,2)] LB ———As you can see, the above quoted Revision has NOT been properly implemented. LB ———The FINAL CORRECT REVISION SHOULD READ: "vi-jā́man mfn. corresponding to each other, i.e. being in pairs, symmetrical, RV.; AV.; ŚBr." LB ———Also, Please note that the added quotation marks, such as seen here: ‘corresponding to each other’ ARE NOT NEEDED in the actual implementation of the Revision. They simply serve the purpose of INDICATING the content of the Revision to be implemented.

Please consider this, you cannot have the NAME "vindhyavāsin" without it bearing direct relation to the EXISTING Headword of that same title. For example, if someone has the name "Idiot", it will be very difficult to convince other people that he is not an Idiot (having such a name). ALSO, I would recommend relocating the Supplementary definition in the Window Display of the Headword "vindhyavāsin" to BELOW the Main Entry Definition. In my view, a Supplementary "Group" should not take precedence over the Main Entry Definition itself. As I have mentioned before, a "group" such as this is simply Happenstance. The fact of "vindhyavāsin" being the N. of a Sāṃkhya teacher is not "antaraṅga" (metaphorically speaking) to the Sanskrit Language itself. Therefore the Main Entry Definition which derives "antaraṅga" from the Sanskrit Language itself deserves precedence to this "Happenstance" grouping from the annexure.

Of course the Supplemental Addition does exist, BUT it should be included with the existing Headword "sa-mud [ID=235354]" LB 4) Now, I admit that I may be WRONG in some part of what has been stated here. The Supplemental Headword "samud [ID=235217.1 sup]" may have a differentiating accent that requires a THIRD listing of the Headword "samud", but then you can see this all begins to get confusing. So I leave up to Jim and Andhrabharati as to what needs to be done here. LB 5) BUT CERTAINLY this Supplemental Headword "accord. to some = ‘conversation’, AV. viii, 1, 15.

The fact is that "the {Supreme/impersonal} Spirit" is being intended here and that is ALWAYS in the neuter gender; Also, the neuter gender should carry through to the end of the definition: there should be no change to "masculine". 2) So does MW desire to change "Brahma" to read "Brahmam" in order to make explicit the neuter Gender Definition?

Aṅkura" be marked as a "print change" and left exactly as it is, of course with the deletion of the "circle-R" Symbol. LB ——This also touches on another point raised recently by Andhrabharati regarding “compound” headings in the annexure. This is my view on the matter:  In cases like "aṅkura", since the Headword already exists in the Main Entry, there is no need to add the additional “aṅkura” from the annexure that precedes the Supplemental compounds, because this will be obious from the proper placement after the existing Headword “Aṅkura” in the Main Entry. In such cases, the “Aṅkura’” heading in the annexure is ONLY serving the purpose of indicating the “pūrvapada” for the following supplementary compounds, but this is already obvious in the Main Entry by the very fact of the Existing Headword “Aṅkura”. I suggest that we ONLY add the “pūvapada” Compound Headword from the annexure into the Main Entry in cases where it simply does not already exist, which of course is less common, but then such a Supplementary Insertion into the Main Entry will be required to make clear the “pūrvapada” Compound Headword and following compounds which will all be inserted from the annexure into the Main Entry and marked accordingly.

As Andhrabharati has noted, "Scott likes to check other dictionaries: Apte, Shabda etc." I check other dictionaries because for my own dictionary I am integrating all information from all reliable sources. The word "aṅgulisaṃdeśa" which has been revised by Monier-Williams is spelled by Apte and Shabda as "aṅgulisandeśa". If we look up the word "saṃdeśa or sandeśa" and then "integrate" the meaning of the compound "aṅgulisaṃdeśa", we will find that this is a LEGITIMATE word in the Sanskrit Language and should NOT be cancelled! In fact I am shocked at the audacity of Monier-Williams! I have heard it said that in the Sanskrit Language there exist Two Million manuscripts that predate the printing press, whereas in the Greek Language the number is a mere twenty thousand. I would like to meet someone who has read all two million manuscripts! Therefore, speaking metaphorically, I take the entire Sanskrit Language as "ākṛtigaṇa" and I do not "close the door" on any possible (and legitimate) word. In fact the masters of language are allowed to 'coin' words (even at times in violation of the rules of grammar). All this being said, for my own dictionary I include both words "aṅgulisaṃdaṃśa" AND "aṅgulisandeśa or aṅgulisaṁdeśa" with a slight variation in meaning according to the "uttarapada" (in each case).

Now, even more interesting is this: Does this Supplemental Definition IN FACT belong to the absolute (indeclinable) form that I have just mentioned? I say, "Yes". There is no gender given and the definition matches to the accepted format for the absolute form: "clinging to (earthly things), Divyāv. [ID=4615.1 sup]". Also I derive this absolute form form the double prefixed root "adhi-ava-√so" which in fact has "grapple with" as one of the possible definitions. "grappling with" and "clinging to" are close enough to link all this together as belonging to the absolute (indeclinable) form as I am suggesting.

So, I am recommending three things to be done: 1) Be sure that the two Headwords "adhyeya" (listed twice) follow each other without interruption by the Headword "adhyetṛ";  2) You may even consider to eliminate the Double Listing of the Headword "adhyeya" since it is actually one and the SAME word deriving from "adhi-√i", simply with the addition of a Supplemental Definition;  3) I also suggest specifically marking this now singular occurence of "adhyeya" as "adhyeya 1" (with the number 1 in the Hierarchy Display) so as to distinguish it from the Homonym "adhyeya 2" which is parsed beginning with the negative particle "a". The fact is this: BOTH the Main Entry as well as the Supplement specifically refer to "adhyeya 1" as distinguished from "adhyeya 2" which is parsed beginning with the negative particle "a".

new = The supplemental insertion of this Headword should be placed (without indentation) just before the word "anāṣṭra [ID=5704]" in the Hierarchical listing of words. The reasoning is as follows:  All of the compounds listed here under the Headword "anāśaka  [ID=5680]" derive from the verbal root: "2. aś [ID=19416]" (with the negative particle "an" as the initial prefix). However, the supplemental word under discussion: "anāśvāsika mfn. [ID=5684.1 sup]" derives from the prefixed root "ā-√śvas" with the negative particle "an" as the initial prefix. Therefore, the Etymology is entirely different; thus the relocation is necessary to please Pāṇini, Jim, Andhrabharati and Scott. (kaching!)

The confusion occurs because the feminine form is "vyavasāyātmikā", however the actual prātipadikam form is "vyavasāyātmaka". Also notice the Etymology listed here: E. vyavasāya, ātman self, kan added. When the affix "kan" is added, the vowel "i" only comes in the feminine gender. Both APTE and MW dictionary list ""vyavasāyātmaka". Also, of course there is the word "ātmaka", and the correct feminine form will be "ātmikā"; but there is no such word as "ātmika".

However, I am uncertain if the word 'para' can be used in the sense of  'accomplishing' (unless this is an extension of the authorized sense of the word para: 'following').
