I consider this Revision to be 'dangerous' and actually an error! As Andhrabharati has noted, ""Scott likes to check other dictionaries: Apte, Shabda etc."" I check other dictionaries because for my own dictionary I am integrating all information from all reliable sources. The word ""aṅgulisaṃdeśa"" which has been revised by Monier-Williams is spelled by Apte and Shabda as ""aṅgulisandeśa"". If we look up the word ""saṃdeśa or sandeśa"" and then ""integrate"" the meaning of the compound ""aṅgulisaṃdeśa"", we will find that this is a LEGITIMATE word in the Sanskrit Language and should NOT be cancelled! In fact I am shocked at the audacity of Monier-Williams! I have heard it said that in the Sanskrit Language there exist Two Million manuscripts that predate the printing press, whereas in the Greek Language the number is a mere twenty thousand. I would like to meet someone who has read all two million manuscripts! Therefore, speaking metaphorically, I take the entire Sanskrit Language as ""ākṛtigaṇa"" and I do not ""close the door"" on any possible (and legitimate) word. In fact the masters of language are allowed to 'coin' words (even at times in violation of the rules of grammar). All this being said, for my own dictionary I include both words ""aṅgulisaṃdaṃśa"" AND ""aṅgulisandeśa or aṅgulisaṁdeśa"" with a slight variation in meaning according to the ""uttarapada"" (in each case)."

LB ——This also touches on another point raised recently by Andhrabharati regarding “compound” headings in the annexure. This is my view on the matter:  In cases like ""aṅkura"", since the Headword already exists in the Main Entry, there is no need to add the additional “aṅkura” from the annexure that precedes the Supplemental compounds, because this will be obious from the proper placement after the existing Headword “Aṅkura” in the Main Entry. In such cases, the “Aṅkura’” heading in the annexure is ONLY serving the purpose of indicating the “pūrvapada” for the following supplementary compounds, but this is already obvious in the Main Entry by the very fact of the Existing Headword “Aṅkura”. I suggest that we ONLY add the “pūvapada” Compound Headword from the annexure into the Main Entry in cases where it simply does not already exist, which of course is less common, but then such a Supplementary Insertion into the Main Entry will be required to make clear the “pūrvapada” Compound Headword and following compounds which will all be inserted from the annexure into the Main Entry and marked accordingly."

I see that this Supplement is part of a ""group"" with the Headword ""vindhyavāsaka"", however this does not require that the Headword ""vindhyavāsin"" should be Doube Listed to ""accomodate"" the group. Please consider this, you cannot have the NAME ""vindhyavāsin"" without it bearing direct relation to the EXISTING Headword of that same title. For example, if someone has the name ""Idiot"", it will be very difficult to convince other people that he is not an Idiot (having such a name). ALSO, I would recommend relocating the Supplementary definition in the Window Display of the Headword ""vindhyavāsin"" to BELOW the Main Entry Definition. In my view, a Supplementary ""Group"" should not take precedence over the Main Entry Definition itself. As I have mentioned before, a ""group"" such as this is simply Happenstance. The fact of ""vindhyavāsin"" being the N. of a Sāṃkhya teacher is not ""antaraṅga"" (metaphorically speaking) to the Sanskrit Language itself.

This MISSING Headword: “vijā́man” has its own placement separate and distinct from ""vijāman mfn. [ID=193039]”.

However, the anusvāra preceding the consonants is accepted as the ""Nasal"" of that particular class of consonants; and that ""Nasal"" whichever it is, always FOLLOWS the proper Anusvāra in Alphabetical Order.

Headword Listed Twice • ALSO, regarding this correction which occurs countless times, it is worth mentioning: 1) A Headword that is printed only ONCE in Devanāgarī script should likewise appear only ONCE as a Headword in the Hierarchy; 2) Any word that contains both a qualitative and a substantive definition does NOT automatically become worthy of a Double Listing in the Hierarchy. As an example consider: A) salty (quality) and B) salt (substantive) – these two definitions would be properly contained within a Single Headword in any given Lexical Hieararchy. And on a final note I consider this to be absolute: 1) quality always and absolutely precedes substantive in every category of existence, because frankly the Guṇas precede the physical manifestation. über-Kaching!	srhodes@snowcrest.net
