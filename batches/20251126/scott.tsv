06/26/2025 06:48:10	MW	22115.1	ākāśagarbha	This Supplemental Entry is a Revision!	On the Authority of Andhrabharati's keen insight, the supplemental entry: "ākāśagarbha" should be treated as a "revision" to the following Headword: "ākāśagarbhi [ID=22116]". The reasoning is as follows: the Main Entry Headword: "ākāśagarbhi" contains the wrong spelling, and the correct spelling has been printed in the annexure as: "ākāśagarbha". Therefore the supplemental entry should not be treated as a separate word to be located within the Main Entry Hierarchy, but rather should be strictly treated as a "revision" to the Main Entry Headword: "ākāśagarbhi [ID=22116]".

Also, Please consider the following Global Correction to be made across ALL dictionaries. Certainly Andhrabharati will appreciate this suggestion. The Global Correction to be made uses the Target Search: "ḍk"  —— becomes —— "ṅk".  The reason that this is a safe Global correction is that although the letter combination "ṭk" is common, it will never be mistaken for "ḍk" (or vice versa). Whereas the letter combination "ḍk" is an absolute impossibility that can only be correctly rendered as: "ṅk". The obvious consideration here is the similarity between the letters "ḍ" and "ṅ" especially in regard to OCR conversion.	srhodes@snowcrest.net

The reason for this is because the compound "īdṛgavastha" is shown to be formed from "īdṛś —> īdṛk + avastha —> īdṛg-avastha". As MW places words such as "īdṛktā" equivalent to proper compounds, then "īdṛgavastha" must follow "īdṛktā", according to proper alphabetical order, and furthermore "īdṛgavastha" must be Double Indented so as to be equivalen with "īdṛktā" (even though the later is not a proper compound but permitted to be treated as such by MW's apologetic footnote!

Please consider this to be a Global correction across all dictionaries – that will save us from repeatedly making such a correction. The important point here is that the letter "ch" is misleading, because the correct letter is: "c". I have made this similar point a number of times, and I would like to hear what the great Andhrabharati has to say in this regard?
