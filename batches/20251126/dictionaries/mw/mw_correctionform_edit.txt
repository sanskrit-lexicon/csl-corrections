Jim: ap: respondent, wil: replicant  (probably source of MW usage)
   https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/replicant  gives the meaning 'One who replies"
 and classifies as 'archaic'.  OED is behind a paywall, but mentions that
 there is one archaic meaning.  Current usage based on science fiction movie
 Blade Runner
conclusion: 'respondent' is made as a print change, as Aumsanskrit suggests.

As MW places words such as "īdṛktā" equivalent to proper compounds, then "īdṛgavastha" must follow "īdṛktā", according to proper alphabetical order, and furthermore "īdṛgavastha" must be Double Indented so as to be equivalen with "īdṛktā" (even though the later is not a proper compound but permitted to be treated as such by MW's apologetic footnote!

The reasoning is as follows: the Main Entry Headword: "ākāśagarbhi" contains the wrong spelling, and the correct spelling has been printed in the annexure as: "ākāśagarbha". Therefore the supplemental entry should not be treated as a separate word to be located within the Main Entry Hierarchy, but rather should be strictly treated as a "revision" to the Main Entry Headword: "ākāśagarbhi [ID=22116]".
