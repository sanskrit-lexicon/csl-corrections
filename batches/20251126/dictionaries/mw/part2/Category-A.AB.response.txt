Jim: AB agrees with Scott EXCEPT
 1. Case 956 L=24186.1, hw=ādhistena. Jim agrees with Scott here
=============================================

* TODOx Case 1883: 10/14/2025 dict=MW, L=31839.1, hw=utsaṅgapādatā, user=srhodes
old = Placement Error
new = The supplemental insertion of this Headword, according to alphabetical ordering, should be placed just before the main entry Headword "utsaṅgavat [ID=31837]".  Also, "utsaṅgapādatā" should be "double-indented", as it is a proper compound.
comment = Placement Error
status = PENDING

** AB comment: 
It is placed at L-31836.7, in my version.
** Jim placed at 31836.7   Note no 31836.6 in cdsl version.
   31836.5  is last utsaNga entry:  'a high number'
------------------------------------------------------------------------
* TODOx Case 1660: 09/20/2025 dict=MW, L=1544.1, hw=aṅgadīya, user=srhodes
old = Placement Error
new = The supplemental insertion of this Headword should be placed just after the word "aṅgadin mfn. [ID=1546.1 sup]" in the Hierarchical listing of words. This correction is proven by glancing at the supplementary section where the Headword "aṅgadīya" is placed BENEATH the primary supplemental word "aṅgadin". This ordering of words with "aṅgadin" (primary) followed by "aṅgadīya" (subordinate) CANNOT be violated when moved into the Main Entry!

** AB comment:
This was relocated by Jim to at "its place" (L-1621.2) in the last commit, after my response (at #101)!
** Jim nothing to do

* TODOx Case 1659: 09/20/2025 dict=MW, L=1546.1, hw=aṅgadin, user=srhodes
old = Placement Error
new = Placement Error LB The supplemental insertion of this Headword should be placed just after the word "aṅgikā f.[ID=1611]" in the Hierarchical listing of words. This correction is proven by glancing at the supplementary section where the Headword "aṅgadin" is placed AFTER all of the supplementary compounds beginning with the stem "aṅga". ALSO, please note that "aṅgadin" should only have a SINGLE indentation in the Hierarchy listing as it is NOT a proper compound, but simply derivative like "aṅgaka and aṅgikā".

* TODOx Case 1647: 09/20/2025 dict=MW, L=29740.1, hw=īdṛgavastha, user=srhodes
old = Placement Error
new = The supplemental insertion of this Headword should be placed just before the word "īdṛktā [ID=29742]" in the Hierarchical listing of words. The reason for this is because the compound "īdṛgavastha" is shown to be formed from "īdṛś —> īdṛk + avastha —> īdṛg-avastha". As MW places words such as "īdṛktā" equivalent to proper compounds, then "īdṛgavastha" must follow "īdṛktā", according to proper alphabetical order, and furthermore "īdṛgavastha" must be Double Indented so as to be equivalen with "īdṛktā" (even though the later is not a proper compound but permitted to be treated as such by MW's apologetic footnote!
comment = Placement Error
status = PENDING

** AB comment:
It is placed at L-29742.1, in my version (maintaining the alphabetic sequence "īdṛg-avastha" > "īdṛk-tā").
------------------------------------------------------------------------
* TODOx Case 1646: 09/20/2025 dict=MW, L=29744.1, hw=īdṛśabhūtatā, user=srhodes
old = Placement Error
new = The supplemental insertion of this Headword should be placed just before the word "īdṛśaka [ID=29743.1]" in the Hierarchical listing of words. Please note that the general rule in MW dictionary is that the forms ending in the affix "ka" ALWAYS come after all of the proper compounds. You may confirm this by checking the placement of the Headword: "rājaka [ID=176824]", by way of example.
comment = Placement Error
status = PENDING

** AB comment:
I haven't separated this out in my version (as it's a parentheical entry within the body matter); but I would suggest to have it placed "as is" in the cdsl text, just below its parent entry.
** Jim : no change. It's a complication that 29743, 29743.1 are 'alternate headwords'
------------------------------------------------------------------------
* TODOx Case 1645: 09/20/2025 dict=MW, L=29744, hw=īdṛśabhūta, user=srhodes
old = Placement Error
new = The supplemental insertion of this Headword should be placed just after the word "īdṛśa [ID=29743]" in the Hierarchical listing of words. Please note that the general rule in MW dictionary is the forms ending in the affix "ka" ALWAYS come after all of the proper compounds. You may confirm this by checking the placement of the Headword: "rājaka [ID=176824]", by way of example
comment = Placement Error
status = PENDING

** AB comment:
No change required, as 29743.1 is "allotted" to the grouped entry "īdṛśaka" (having the higher precedence).
------------------------------------------------------------------------
* TODOx Case 1623: 09/16/2025 dict=MW, L=29479.2, hw=iṣuparṣin, user=srhodes
old = Placement Error
new = The supplemental insertion of this Headword should be placed just before the word "iṣupāta [ID=29479.1 sup]" in the Hierarchical listing of words. The reason for this ordering is because it precisely follows the order given in the Supplementary Section. This order can not be violated in the Main Entry when no other word comes between them!
comment = Placement Error
status = PENDING

** AB comment:
I have the two entries interchanged in L-numbers, in my version; iṣuparṣin (L-29479.1) & iṣupāta (L-29479.2), maintaintaing the proper order.
** Jim: cdsl follows  AB solution; this agrees with Scott. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
* TODOx Case 1405: 08/27/2025 dict=MW, L=64205.2, hw=galarandhra, user=srhodes
old = Placement Error
** new = The supplemental insertion 
of this Headword should be placed just BEFORE the word "galavārtta [ID=64258]" in the Hierarchical listing of words. The reason for this placement is that the supplemental compound "galarandhra" is formed from 2. gala which refers to the "neck" !
comment = Placement Error
status = PENDING

** AB comment:
It is placed at L-64257.2, in my version.
** Jim : see case 1404

old = Placement Error
** new = The supplemental insertion
of this Headword should be placed just after the word "galamekhalā [ID=64257]" in the Hierarchical listing of words. The reason for this placement is that the supplemental compound "galamoṭana" is formed from 2. gala which refers to the "neck" !
comment = Placement Error
status = PENDING

** AB comment:
It is placed at L-64257.1, in my version.
** Jim Moved 64205.1, 64205.2 to 24257.1, 24257.2 . Agrees with Scott/AB

old = Placement Error
new = The supplemental insertion of this Headword should be placed just after the word "galagolī [ID=64249]" in the Hierarchical listing of words. The reason for this placement is that the supplemental compound "galagranthi" is formed from 2. gala which refers to the "neck" !
comment = Placement Error

* TODOx Case 1270: 08/13/2025 dict=MW, L=15588.1, hw=ark, user=srhodes
old = Placement Error
new = The supplemental insertion of this Headword should be placed just after the word ""arkya [ID=15667]" in the Hierarchical listing of words. In this way all of the proper compounds for "1. arka" are listed first. Andhrabharati has confirmed this placement correction as well.
comment = Placement Error
status = PENDING

** AB comment:
Scott has mis-spelt the entry-word here!
It is "2. arka", which I had placed at L-15667.1, in my version.
** Jim  move to 15588.1 tp 15667.1, per Scott/AB
------------------------------------------------------------------------
* TODOx Case 1073: 07/30/2025 dict=MW, L=25828.4, hw=āyāsya, user=srhodes
old = Double Indentation Error in the Hierarchy Listing.
new = Make a Single Indentation of this Headword in the Hierarchy Listing. Also, Please note that the Headword "āyāsya", may be better placed AFTER the Headword "āyāsin", according to the alphabetical order of letters within the word (as 'sy' follows 'si').
comment = Double Indentation Error in the Hierarchy Listing.
status = PENDING

** AB comment:
It is placed at L-25830.1 as H2 entry, in my version.

* TODOx Case 1070: 07/30/2025 dict=MW, L=25828.1, hw=āyāsadāyin, user=srhodes
old = Placement Error
new = The supplemental insertion of this Headword should be placed just after the word "āyāsa m. [ID= 25826]" as "āyāsadāyin" is a proper compound formed from the pūrvapada "āyāsa".
comment = Placement Error
status = PENDING

** AB comment:
It is placed at L-25827.1 as H3 entry, in my version.
** Jim: move 25828.1 to 25827.1, per AB/Scott
------------------------------------------------------------------------
* TODOx Case 956: 07/16/2025 dict=MW, L=24186.1, hw=ādhistena, user=srhodes
old = Placement Error
new = The supplemental insertion of this Headword should be placed just after the word "ādhibhoga [ID=24131]" in the Hierarchical listing of words. Please note that definition in both cases refers to "a deposit", and thus the correct location of this compound "ādhistena" is confirmed!
comment = Placement Error
status = PENDING

** AB comment:
No need to change its placement; it is properly placed after ādhirathīya & ādhirājya (in the suppl. sequence).
** Jim:  move 24186.1 to 24131.1, per Scott , also mark as H3 (cpd. of ADi)
         Acc. to WIL, ādhirājya is derived from adhirāja .

* TODOx Case 414: 05/29/2025 dict=MW, L=158220, hw=marīcopapurāṇa, user=srhodes
old = Placement Error
new = The Headword "marīcopapurāṇa" should be placed under (and after) the Headword "marīca [ID=158187]" as it decomposes to "marīca + upapurāṇa". This correction has been confirmed by the great authority Andhrabharati. As a side note, we hope that Dr. Dhaval is alive and well.
comment = Placement Error
status = PENDING

** AB comment:
Regular compounding "upapurāṇa" with "marīci" would be "marīcyupapurāṇa"; but herein the v.l. form "marīca" of "marīci" is intended, which properly compounds to "marīcopapurāṇa".
The pwk listed the entries alphabetically, thus putting "marīcopapurāṇa" after "marīcipaṭala, marīcipattana, marīcimat & marīcimālin".
MW has blindly kept "marīcopapurāṇa" under "marīci" along with these, without paying attention to the decomposition of the word!
** Jim: move 158220 to 158187.1, as H3 in hierarchy. per Scott/AB
------------------------------------------------------------------------
* TODOx Case 389: 05/27/2025 dict=MW, L=19413.1, hw=aśanakriyā, user=srhodes
old = Placement Error
new = Based upon the definition given, this Supplemental Compound must be placed under the Headword "2. áśana n. eating, [ID=19417]". Therefore, following the proper alphabetical order, the Supplemental Headword "aśanakriyā", must be placed just after the Main Entry Headword "aśanakṛ́t mfn. preparing food, [ID=19420]".
comment = Placement Error
status = PENDING

** AB comment:
It is placed at L-19420.1 as H3 entry, in my version.
** Jim: move 19413.1 to 19420.1 H3, per Scott/AB

* TODOx Case 309: 05/17/2025 dict=MW, L=137080.1, hw=praviṣṭadīkṣa, user=srhodes
old = pra-viṣṭadīkṣa
new = pra-viṣṭa-dīkṣa  (Jim: this change done)
comment = Typo – Please note that in addition to the correction made above, there is also a "Placement Error" in locating this Supplemental Entry into the Main Entry Hierarchy. Since this is a "Proper Compound" formed by the pūrvapada "praviṣṭa", it must necessarily be placed prior to the Headword "praviṣṭaka [ID=137080 ]", which is not a "Proper Compound", but rather a derivative formed with the affix "ka". This is the standard procedure  followed in MW dictionary, and I hope that Andhrabharati will notice his name here, and confirm this placement correction which has been clearly stated.
status = PENDING  Placement Error not done

** AB comment:
It is placed at L-137079.1 as H3 entry, in my version.

old = Placement Error
new = The supplemental insertion of this Headword should be placed just after the word "avamūrdhaśaya mfn. [ID=17809 ]" in the Hierarchical listing of words. The reason for this correction follows the standard of placing words ending in "ka" AFTER all of the "proper" compounds formed from the pūrvapada.

There is no difference in accent, and this Headword must neither be listed twice nor be listed against the proper Alphabetical order of Compounds coming under "arvāk".
