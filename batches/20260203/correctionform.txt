It is a technical point, but please consider that the affix used is defined by Apte himself as: "शस् A Taddhita affix forming adverbs from nouns". Therefore, the affix being "śas" would be better kept as such!  Also, please consider that Apte likes to list masculine nouns as ending in "aḥ".  So the correction that I am suggesting above honors both the actual form of the affix "śas", while providing a visual distinction from the common masculine form. Finally, if there are any other words in Apte dictionary that end in the Taddhita affix "śas", then I am recommending a Global Correction to all such cases following this very example: all indeclinable words listed by Apte as ending in "śaḥ" should be corrected to ending in "śas" – The Actual Affix!

comment = Typo – Please note that this is a suggested "print change". The word "annumeration" appears to be considered "obsolete". I know that Andhrabharati likes to retain obsolete words, however I prefer to go with the "spirit" rather than the "letter" of the law (so to speak). I hope that Jim Funderburk will give this some thought. Cologne online dictionaries are presenting the "Ultimate Corrected Editions" with "Print Changes" for the benefit of Humanity – and why correct the "Sanskrit" and not the "English" as well? So it is important to be clear when and where to "Draw the Line", and why "Stagnate" the inevitable evolution of language. "Accurate Meaning" should be the "Rule", not "Curating" Archaic and Obsolete words, in honor of the Deceased.
