(many occurrences here) doesn't work (a problem i guess related to the fact it is here at the end of sentences); note also "esp. de de datte." (a misprint in the book) should be "esp. de datte." Also "c. à d." (several occurences here, and probably in the whole dictionary i guess) should be "c.-à-d." (i.e.) also one occurrence of "c. a d." (not properly referenced and writen), same, to be replaced by "c.-à-d." also two occurences of "sansevière" (a plant name) mispelt (sanseviére & sanseviere).
