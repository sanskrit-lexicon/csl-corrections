The confirmation of this correction can be understood from the placement of the denominative form "aghāya" which occurs in the main entry after the word "aghala". This proves that the proper placement of the denominative "aghaya" should come just before the word "aghala" in the main entry Hierarchy listing.

The absolute proof of this correction is as follows:  the word "aṅkulī" itself is a supplemental insertion, and the word "aṅkūraya" follows the word "aṅkulī" in the supplemental section. Therefore, when these two words are inserted into the main entry their alphabetical placement relative to each other must be respected!
