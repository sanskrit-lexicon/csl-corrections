* case 1: 11/02/2024 dict=MW, L=5932, hw=anilambhasamādhi, user=srhodes
old = Contest Between Main Entry and Supplement
new = Here is a rare case where the Supplemental Entry is actually the Primary Word for a compound Headword listed in the Main Entry in Devanāgarī script. Certainly we will be hearing from Andhrabharati on this. I emphatically state that the Primary Word "anilambha [ID=5931.3 sup]" (although found in the Supplementary Section) Overrules the Devanāgarī Script of the Compound word "anilambhasamādhi [ID=5932]". Please remember that All Supplemental words are Supplemental in MW dictionary by Happenstance. These Supplemental words are not Supplemental to the Sanskrit Language itself. Therefore the Headword "anilambha [ID=5931.3 sup]" should be treated as though in Devanāgarī Script and the Headword "anilambhasamādhi [ID=5932]" should be "demoted" and receive the proper indentation due to its being an undeniable compound formed from this Supplemental Word: "anilambha". (Super-kaching!)
comment = Contest Between Main Entry and Supplement

  Yes, Scott -- compound of H1 is viewed as H3 in my current understanding.

However, the preceding Headword "aniveśana [ID=5946]" derives from the prefixed root "ni-√viś". So there is no etymological relation here, and therefore the indentation is incorrect! (kaching!)

comment = Typo – Along with the above printed correction, I would add the following (as a print change): "m. an ascetic, L.; mfn. expeditious". I would like to meet someone who says, "expeditious is NOT an adjective". Therefore I am suggesting that we add, "mfn." to the "expeditious" definition. SHABDA agrees!
status = done? Changed typo.  But 'mfn. expeditious' NOT added.
  Reason 1: other dictionaries
   ap90  1 A courier, express messenger.
   gst: 1 A courier, an express, a runner. 2 An ascetic, 
   mw72: m. an ascetic; a courier. 
   probably others
  Reason 2:  We can interpret  m. अनुकम्प्यः  as 'one who is expeditious' ( I think
    this would be called a bahuvrIhi interpretation)
  Reason 3: AFAIK, there is no specific concept of 'adjective' in Sanskrit.
  BTW: SHS is a variant of WIL, who also has expeditious as mfn.

new = Please note that the Headword "anugā" is printed in Devanāgarī text! There are actually TWO words that have the form: "anugā". 
The first "anugā" is the feminine form of the word "anuga" which derives from the prefixed root "anugam". 
The second "anugā [ID=6210]" which is the Emergency being discussed here is the prefixed root "anugā" itself, pure and simple. 
This second "anugā [ID=6210]" MUST BE RELOCATED in the Hierarchy List to just before the Headword "anugādin [ID=6211]". 
I do see that the Supplemental listing: "anugā (also) to undergo [ID=6210.1 sup]" IS CORRECTLY placed at this location. HOWEVER, the Main Entry "anugā [ID=6210]" is misplaced and grouped under the root "anugam [ID=6183]". (Super-Duper-kaching!) and 100,000 points – JACKPOT!

Will the primary listing of Headword "anugīta" please stand up! In Fact... APTE offers the solution: "anugītam Singing in response to" (of course neuter gender).

As you can see, there is some similarity here. Of course the Headword "an-ūtsarga" needs to be relocated as I previously indicated. And of course both these words begin with the negative particle "an". One other interesting point is this: I have heard it said: "a negative provision cannot exist unless there first is a related positive provision (to be negated)."  In the case of the word "an-uddhāna", we are obviously "negating" the existing word "uddhāna", but what on Earth are we negating in the word "an-ūtsarga". There is no such word as "ūtsarga", but there is the word "utsarga", which leads me to suspect a spelling error. It is worth mentioning again that the vowel preceding the conjunct consonant "ts" is a guru vowel (heavy) and in oral pronunciation the "long" or "short" vowel preceding the conjunct consonant may be mixed up in confusion.

Since the word "utsarga" does indeed mean "abandoning", I consider this Headword to properly be "an-utsarga" meaning "non-abandonment".

Also, please note that the word "anekasaṃsthāna [ID=7841.2 sup]" correctly precedes the word "anekasaṃkhya [ID=7841.1 sup]" in the Supplemental Section, and therefore when inserting both words into the Main Entry their relative position to each other cannot be reversed! (kaching!); Also please note how MW dictionary recognizes the Alphabetical order of FIRST listing the anusvāra preceding the sibilant "ṃs", and only after that comes the anusvāra preceding the consonant "ṃkh". This is standard practice throughout MW dictionary, and an accepted fact of the Sanskrit Language. It is not a "practice among certain people." It is absolutely the correct ordering and any other ordering is absolutely incorrect. As I have stated before: "The anusvāra first precedes the semivowels, then the sibilants, the the letter h, and lastly the consonants beginning with k." A simple way to understand this reasoning is as follows: the Proper Anusvāra precedes ALL nasals according to Standard Alphabetical Order. However, the anusvāra preceding the consonants is accepted as the "Nasal" of that particular class of consonants. That "Nasal" whichever it is, always FOLLOWS the proper Anusvāra in Alphabetical Order. However, the Anusvāra preceding the semivowels, sibilants and letter h, NEVER changes to a nasal, but always remains an anusvāra and therefore always comes first in proper Alphabetical order.

old = Group Contest
new = If I may use the following terms metaphorically: "antaraṅga" and "bahiraṅga" ;  and if I may apply them to the "grouping" concept that was discussed previously in regard to the contest between “grouping” and “alphabetical order”. I would like to say that the two words: “antar—vartin or antar—vasat” , may be considered as a “bahiraṅga” grouping. While the word “antarvartinī [ID=8152 sup]” is the feminine form of the Headword “antarvartin”, and therefore, I consider these two words: “antarvartin and antarvartinī” to be an “antaraṅga grouping” (metaphorically speaking). This “antraṅga grouping” is stronger by the grammatical fact of linguistic structure to any grouping by happenstance such as “antarvartin or antarvasat” which I consider to be a “bahiraṅga grouping” (metaphorically speaking). On the basis of these considerations my suggestion is as follows: 
Relocate the Headword “antarvartinī  [ID=8152 sup]” to immediately after the word “antarvartin” and make an indentation adjustments which may be necessary. Then after the Headword “antarvartinī”, will follow the Headword “antarvasat”. 
One last point is that the Headword stated as: "antar—vartinī f. pregnant". Obviously we have the feminine gender but an "adjective" definition. I consider this to be an awkward affair. For my own purposes, I have altered the definition to be more true to linguistic interpretation as follows: "antar—vartinī f. a pregnant woman". This "updated" definition is what I call, "follow through."
comment = Group Contest
status = not done? 
  antarvartin, antar vasat is an 'alternate headword group' coded as:
<L>8151<pc>43,3<k1>antarvartin<k2>antar—vartin<e>3
<s>antar—vartin</s> or <s>antar—vasat</s>, ¦ <lex>mfn.</lex> internal, included, dwelling in.<info lex="m:f:n"/>
<LEND>
<L>8151.1<pc>43,3<k1>antarvasat<k2>antar—vasat<e>3
{{Lbody=8151}}
<LEND>

There is no way for  antarvartinI to break into the group.
We could code the group by copying text manually:
<L>8151<pc>43,3<k1>antarvartin<k2>antar—vartin<e>3
<s>antar—vartin</s> or <s>antar—vasat</s>, ¦ <lex>mfn.</lex> internal, included, dwelling in.<info lex="m:f:n"/>
<LEND>
<L>8151.1<pc>43,3<k1>antarvasat<k2>antar—vasat<e>3
<s>antar—vartin</s> or <s>antar—vasat</s>, ¦ <lex>mfn.</lex> internal, included, dwelling in.<info lex="m:f:n"/>
<LEND>

and then insert antarvartinI as 8151.05.

I've noticed a few other such instances.
My conclusion is that the current way (vartin, vasat, vartinI) is the 
least problematic.

   In current case, <e>1 seems better.

comment = Typo – Please note that this is a suggested "Print Change". APTE does NOT require the "plural" for this definition. Also, it is VERY unusual for the neuter gender of such words and definitions to "require plural". When something is not stated, then we can take it as "anyatarasyām". I am certain that in the vast and extensive literature of the Sanskrit language, this particular word "dhikkṛtam" is NOT required to be plural according to the usage of the master. By the way, my number one favorite Grammatical Rule for Sanskrit is this: "according to the usage of the masters!".

comment = Typo – Please note that this is a suggested "print change". Obviously when reading the printed page, it is easy enough to follow the direction: "= prec. n. pl."; BUT for MW online, I prefer definitions to be directly stated. Perhaps in certain grammatical cases it is preferable to give a definition by reference, but here I prefer "sākṣāt !"
