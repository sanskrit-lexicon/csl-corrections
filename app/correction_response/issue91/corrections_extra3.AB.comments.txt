old = Contest Between Main Entry and Supplement
new = Here is a rare case where the Supplemental Entry is actually the Primary Word for a compound Headword listed in the Main Entry in Devanāgarī script.
Certainly we will be hearing from Andhrabharati on this.
I emphatically state that the Primary Word "anilambha [ID=5931.3 sup]" (although found in the Supplementary Section) Overrules the Devanāgarī Script of the Compound word "anilambhasamādhi [ID=5932]".
Please remember that All Supplemental words are Supplemental in MW dictionary by Happenstance.
These Supplemental words are not Supplemental to the Sanskrit Language itself.
Therefore the Headword "anilambha [ID=5931.3 sup]" should be treated as though in Devanāgarī Script and the Headword "anilambhasamādhi [ID=5932]" should be "demoted" and receive the proper indentation due to its being an undeniable compound formed from this Supplemental Word: "anilambha". (Super-kaching!)

* case 5: 11/02/2024 dict=MW, L=6210, hw=anugā, user=srhodes
old = Emergency
new = Please note that the Headword "anugā" is printed in Devanāgarī text! There are actually TWO words that have the form: "anugā". 
The first "anugā" is the feminine form of the word "anuga" which derives from the prefixed root "anugam". 
The second "anugā [ID=6210]" which is the Emergency being discussed here is the prefixed root "anugā" itself, pure and simple. 
This second "anugā [ID=6210]" MUST BE RELOCATED in the Hierarchy List to just before the Headword "anugādin [ID=6211]". 
I do see that the Supplemental listing: "anugā (also) to undergo [ID=6210.1 sup]" IS CORRECTLY placed at this location.
HOWEVER, the Main Entry "anugā [ID=6210]" is misplaced and grouped under the root "anugam [ID=6183]". (Super-Duper-kaching!) and 100,000 points – JACKPOT!

Of course, we find the feminine form: "anugītā", but I am still not going to let this slide! Will the primary listing of Headword "anugīta" please stand up!
In Fact... APTE offers the solution: "anugītam Singing in response to" (of course neuter gender).
But when MW uses the word "(also)" we should NOT have to refer to APTE to justify the usage. (kaching!)

I have considered this as a print change ["(also)" to come before 〔mfn.〕] in the annexure and placed these two as 6226.4 -> 6227.1 (<e>2B) & 6226.5 -> 6227.2 (<e>2B).
There are 80 instances having "(also) <lex>" and 110 instances having "</lex> (also)"! 

And, there are many precedents in the main pages for 〔mfn.〕 following other genders, instead of being the first one in the sibling group.

[There are innumerable cases of this kind throughout the MW text.]

Of course, this IS a "phwchild" candidate in Jim's notation, and a "mappable entry" as per Scott's thinking.

So far as I am concerned, this belongs to the class of in-line HWs that I had recently referred to in my earlier comment in another file.
And I had identified few such classes, incl. the "v. l." type, that Scott has suggested to bring into the searching scope.
My intention was exactly the same, in identifying [and marking separately(!)] all such cases.

AB comment:
==========
We may see that "kept" is the key word here, that renders it to be under the 'pā' (= keep) root.
The "anupAl" entry is the referring place (in Jim's notation, 'a'-homonym), which is referring to "anupA" [the referred place] (in Jim's notation, 'b'-homonym).

And it is seen that all the compound or derived words are coming under the referred place, whether in the main pages or in the annexure data insertion process [initially done by Pawan Goyal et al. in 2014 (with multiple variety of errors, as being identifying now!!)], as Jim mentioned in the mwheader.xml file).

As such, if any insertion is identified to be at the referring place, it has to be properly relocated to the referred place.


Jim response = Nothing to do?  AB's explains why anupālya is under "2. anupA" -- good!
   AB's comments regarding the artificial homonyms seems a bit off the mark.
   There are no artificial homonyms involved with anupAl since there is only
   one entry for anupAl; the artificial homonyms were (I think) restricted to
   where the referred word is same as referring word. Also, I think AB's
   distinction between a-homonym and b-homonym  (referring referred) is not
   what Pawan (and Peter) were thinking of -- a and b when assigned would be
   sequential  (For example, if words A and B occur on pages M and N (and are
   not homonyms) and if M < N, then A would be marked with 'a' homonym and
   B marked with 'b' homonym;  while if M>N, then B would be marked 'a' and
]  A marked 'b'. Pawal had a Java program that did something like this, as I recall.

AB comment:
==========
Scott's query—
The supplemental definition given is simply a direction pointing within the Main Entry itself! Why bother with such circuitousness?!

AB's response—
It is THE standing rule (followed by MW) to refer to the place [that the word 'resides'] in his 'conceived' root-based mapping of words, for any word that a user generally tends to look [having "alphabetical order" in his mind].
And in this case, the said word is given as an example, which is one of the types of entries that could be brought under searching by employing some mechansim!
[cf. my comment under "case: 21" above.]

And it is seen that Jim has succumbed to Scott's posts (of this type) & making many print-changes; I had ignored all such changes, as they are all some kind of user-corrections.
BTW, when I really had to mark my comments (to justify the matter), where the point otherwise does not immediately strike the reader's mind, I had enclosed the matter as %...%; there are about 2-3 hundred such places in the whole of MW.
[And similar insertions are made in the other works too (I wonder if Jim recalls seeing them while he was working with my files).]

  future maintainers can undo such changes that they consider foolish.

Scott apparently does not bother much about accents, and Jim has been saying (from the very beginnig days since I started interacting) that he is NOT into the matters dealing with accents.

This is a case of accent correction (revision)--

Scott should probably do all these "extraneous" corrections/additions in his own file-copy, to "enhance" his mapping.

Jim used to say thus earlier, when someone was asking for some kind of change or modification not in the print (that cannot be considered as a 'genuine' print-change); but somehow he has been incorporating such changes (luckily only sometimes, not always!!) against Scott's posts these days.

This entire word and definition are given in parentheses in the Supplemental section.
However, in the Main Entry, we do not find the Headword in parantheses.
And consider this, Does the Sanskrit Language have any words that are "parenthetical" as opposed to other words which are not?
A parenthetical listing is simply "Happenstance" it is not a fact inherent in the Sanskrit Language itself.
Therefore, I vote to eliminate the parentheses which actually only "weaken" the fact of a clear definition which needs no apology.
The definition IS the definition it is not "parenthetically" the definition.

There are entries in the main pages also, that sometimes puts just the HW (or header portion), sometimes the body portion, and sometimes the whole matter in parenthesis; these are different from the example type that we've seen above in case 21, which are mostly taken as phwchilds by Jim.

AB comment:
==========
I was initially taking that Jim would be implementing the annexure integration of MW also, just as in GRA (as has been talked of at various places, and even agreed in principle by Jim), which does have the faility of clickable access to annexure page alongwith displaying the text matter "as is" showing what the annexure entry is saying (as del, chg & add types).

He is (very much) having access to the MW annexure entries typed separately (done long long ago), to start-off the MW annexure integration exactly in the same fashion as in GRA.
But when the actual process started he has resorted to another style, a "stripped-down" and "modified" version of the GRA style!

I was not in a mood to respond on the point, when he had asked for the opinion by others; but Dhaval (who is not so active now at CDSL), Marcis (who for most of the times forgets the happenings even if they are at his requests) & Scott (who probably is not aware of the GRA process) have simply praised Jim's action.

If (and when) I take up the integration of MW annexure on 'once-for-all' basis as intended (that got stalled for some reason), it would be in the GRA style.


Jim response = Nothing to do (with mw.txt). The 'GRA style' for suppl. primarily means, for me,
   using the <chg> syntax at least for "rev".  I still think that is a good
   idea because (where applicable) it shows both the old and new.
   Obviously this <chg> has only been applied sporadically 
   with Scott's submissions.  Also, the <chg> markup may not be
   applicable for all the MW "rev" cases.
   I don't understand :  "stripped-down" and "modified" version of the GRA style!

This appears more like a 'repeat' entry.

The annexure is clearly asking this to be under the 'antar-' comp.-header (i.e. L-8049); hence no relocation (from L-8070.2) required.

For any reason [violating the entry-order of annexure (Rule No. 1, as I had mentioned earlier)], if this has to be put at the place Scott is suggesting, this would more likely be a "rev"--

replacing the terminating string with the starting string; the HW itself doesn't getting change finally! And the 〔f.〕 is to retained, as supported

This is placed as per the annexure's entry-order at 8128.2, under the 'antar' comp.-header.
No need of any relocation.


Jim response = no change.  Clearly antarBUta is derived from antarBU, p. 44,2.
      So 8306 is a better spot, and should take precedence over the 
      placement of antarBUta among the compounds of antar from suppl. 
      antarBAva on 43,3 refers to p. 44,2. 
      So there are reasons for both placements.  

      Deciding which is better seems to me on a par 
      with deciding "how many angels can dance on the head of a pin?"

* case 54: 10/30/2024 dict=MW, L=8152, hw=antarvartinī, user=srhodes
old = Group Contest
new = If I may use the following terms metaphorically: "antaraṅga" and "bahiraṅga" ; and if I may apply them to the "grouping" concept that was discussed previously in regard to the contest between “grouping” and “alphabetical order”.
I would like to say that the two words: “antar—vartin or antar—vasat” , may be considered as a “bahiraṅga” grouping.
While the word “antarvartinī [ID=8152 sup]” is the feminine form of the Headword “antarvartin”, and therefore, I consider these two words: “antarvartin and antarvartinī” to be an “antaraṅga grouping” (metaphorically speaking).
This “antraṅga grouping” is stronger by the grammatical fact of linguistic structure to any grouping by happenstance such as “antarvartin or antarvasat” which I consider to be a “bahiraṅga grouping” (metaphorically speaking).
On the basis of these considerations my suggestion is as follows: 
Relocate the Headword “antarvartinī  [ID=8152 sup]” to immediately after the word “antarvartin” and make an indentation adjustments which may be necessary.
Then after the Headword “antarvartinī”, will follow the Headword “antarvasat”. 
One last point is that the Headword stated as: "antar—vartinī f. pregnant". Obviously we have the feminine gender but an "adjective" definition.
I consider this to be an awkward affair. For my own purposes, I have altered the definition to be more true to linguistic interpretation as follows: "antar—vartinī f. a pregnant woman".
This "updated" definition is what I call, "follow through."
comment = Group Contest
status = not done? 
  antarvartin, antar vasat is an 'alternate headword group' coded as:
<L>8151<pc>43,3<k1>antarvartin<k2>antar—vartin<e>3
<s>antar—vartin</s> or <s>antar—vasat</s>, ¦ <lex>mfn.</lex> internal, included, dwelling in.<info lex="m:f:n"/>
<LEND>
<L>8151.1<pc>43,3<k1>antarvasat<k2>antar—vasat<e>3
{{Lbody=8151}}
<LEND>

There is no way for  antarvartinI to break into the group.
We could code the group by copying text manually:
<L>8151<pc>43,3<k1>antarvartin<k2>antar—vartin<e>3
<s>antar—vartin</s> or <s>antar—vasat</s>, ¦ <lex>mfn.</lex> internal, included, dwelling in.<info lex="m:f:n"/>
<LEND>
<L>8151.1<pc>43,3<k1>antarvasat<k2>antar—vasat<e>3
<s>antar—vartin</s> or <s>antar—vasat</s>, ¦ <lex>mfn.</lex> internal, included, dwelling in.<info lex="m:f:n"/>
<LEND>

and then insert antarvartinI as 8151.05.

I've noticed a few other such instances.
My conclusion is that the current way (vartin, vasat, vartinI) is the 
least problematic.

If the way Scott is to be taken up, it should be done in a comprehensive way, resulting in another edition altogether; no tinkering job (changing things here and there) against the theme and plan of Monier Williams!
And no one ever would dare take up such a project, in the present times!!


Jim response = nothing to do. As AB suggests, I must be vigilant when
 evaluating some of Scott's more elaborate suggestions.

 BTW, AB himself appears to be taking a comprehensive approach to MW, which may

Good step taken, Jim! But you have placed these at a very wrong place.

If you had spent few seconds to cross-check with meanings of the existing entries -kAraka, -kft etc. where you've placed these, you would've noticed that they all belong to a 'different world' altogether.
And then, have a look at the annexure entry order which clearly shows this 'anyat-' group before the groups anyataH, anyatara etc.

The appropriate place for this anyat- group (containing 4 said entries) is then
 L-8632.1 to L-8732.4 (newly formed)


Jim response = Done. This will preserve the 'anyat' paragraph of suppl. and
   the 'anyat-kAraka' paragraph of the main.  I guess the 'different world'

     The 'anyat' paragraph is NOT so related.

Good to see Scott picking up the text strings from the qualifier-portion (which I had termed for the matter between the entry word (header) and its meaning (body) portions [this includes the lexical info and/or any citations etc. lying between the two portions]).
These strings serve the purpose of cross-checking of newly formed entry-words (esp. accent that differs, either present or absent, from the parent stem-word of the whole group) in the digital text data (that were left to user's imagination, in "indicative mode" in the print).

Also please note that the word "apakaṣāyatva" itself should be considered a "Supplemental Word" and therefore its following listing in the Hierarchy will be marked as Supplemental.

<s>apa-nidhi</s> (9292.1), <s>apa-niṣā́duka</s> (9294.1), <s>apa-ninīṣā</s> (9301.2) and <s>apa-ninī°ṣu</s> (9301.3), <s>apa-neya</s> (9308.1)

I have the order retained as earlier; because we can see MW puts quite many related entries wide apart, instead of in a contiguous group (having 'devised' a rather complicated order for his work).
And I do not see any strong reason to break his 'theme' for cases like this, howmuchever sensible they might be, unless there are precedents by MW himself doing the same.


Jim response = revert to original placement.  
    A struggle between two ideas:
     1. annexure order preservation in placement within main. 
        apaninIzA/zu precede apanizAduka
     2. words derived from a root placed under the root.
        apanizAduka precedes apaninizA/zu 
    When in conflict, which of these should prevail?
    I go back and forth, back and forth.

* case 75: 11/02/2024 dict=MW, L=9292.3, hw=apaninīṣu, user=srhodes
old = Placement Error
new = The supplemental insertion of this Headword should be placed just before the word "apanīta [ID=9302]" in the Hierarchical listing of words.
The reason for this is the obvious fact of the Desiderative formed word from the prefixed root "apa-nī". (Super-kaching!)

The Headword "aparagodāni" should have its own Headword in the Hierarchy list along with the "circle-S" supplementary symbol.

AB comment:

It is the genral practice to put the 〔m.〕 entries first, then 〔f.〕 entries and thereafter the 〔n.〕 entries within the "stem-group" blocks as siblings (of course, this stem-group would also contain 〔mfn.〕 entries mostly at the beginning and the 〔ind.〕 entries mostly at the ending of the group), irrespective (!) of their alphabetical ordering.
As such, this should better be put a step above at L-9429.2.


Jim response = not done. These two words are not in the same stem group.
              Thus, alphabetical order determines entry order.

* case 80: 10/28/2024 dict=MW, L=9528, hw=aparābhava, user=srhodes
old = not succumbing, victory, MBh. [ID=9528 sup]
new = a-parābhava m. not succumbing, victory, MBh. [ID=9528 sup]
comment = Typo – Also, please note that there is an interesting question here regarding the indentation in the Hierarchy List.
Especially taking into consideration the following two words: "aparābhāva" and "aparābhūta".
Obviously all three words derive from the same source, so their treatment as an etymological group, should be considered in their relative "indentation" status. Is this another contest? (kaching!)
status = done <e>2 -> <e>1 . In placing the revisions such as anuBava we sometimes 
   set <e>1 and sometimes <e>2.  In main, <e>1 means Devanagari headword.
   But why did MW write aparABUta in Roman? 
   In current case, <e>1 seems better.
   
AB comment:
==========
"But why did MW write aparABUta in Roman?"-- because it is an inflexional form (from -bhAva)


Jim response = nothing to do, but ...
     "inflexional forms of BAva" are BAvaH, BAvO, BAvAH, ...  right?

* case 86: 11/02/2024 dict=MW, L=101199, hw=dhikkṛta, user=srhodes
old = n. pl. reproach, contempt
new = n. reproach, contempt
comment = Typo – Please note that this is a suggested "Print Change". APTE does NOT require the "plural" for this definition.
Also, it is VERY unusual for the neuter gender of such words and definitions to "require plural".
When something is not stated, then we can take it as "anyatarasyām".
I am certain that in the vast and extensive literature of the Sanskrit language, this particular word "dhikkṛtam" is NOT required to be plural according to the usage of the master.
By the way, my number one favorite Grammatical Rule for Sanskrit is this: "according to the usage of the masters!".
status = not changed. PW also has n. pl.

AB comment:
=========
Whoever has said (or wrote) it, and how many people might have followed & used it, (after all) an error is an ERROR.
And then, as the great Patañjali's final verdict (which Scott had put in his own words here) goes, it is ultimately the usage by the learned that makes the vocables [vocable (from Latin: vocabulum) is any identifiable utterance or writing, such as a word or term, that is fixed by their language and culture] declared 'proper'; otherwise they are treated as 'apabhraṃśa'.

Though PWG did not have this word as an entry as such, it IS the first one mentioningthe word [under the धिक् entry, as an example] as being an "〔adj.〕" lexically, citing two Amarakośa places & others (all of which indeed are adjectives in the resp. works) and as  "〔n.〕 ⁅pl.⁆" lexically, citing the Daśakumāracarita (from Benfey's Chrestomathie)--
	धिक्कृत <ls>AK. 3,1,39. 2,43.</ls> <ls>H. 440.</ls> <ls>MBh. 5,2155.</ls> <ls>R. 6,88,18.</ls> <ls>Bhāg. P. 7,8,53.</ls> 〔n.〕 ⁅pl.⁆ <i>Missbilligung, Vorwürfe</i> <ls>Daśak.</ls> in <ls>Benf. Chr. 185,1.</ls>

Now, let's see the <ls>Daśak.</ls> citation, which goes like this--
	अहमेव किलामुष्याः स्मरोन्मादहेतुरासम् । आसीनयोश्चावयोर्मामेवोपगम्य सा नीलोत्पलमयमिवापाङ्गदामाङ्गे मम सुञ्चन्ती तं जनमपत्रपयाधोमुखं व्यधत्त । सुभगंमन्येन च मया स्वधनस्य स्वगृहस्य स्वगणस्य स्वदेहस्य स्वजीववितस्य च सैवेश्वरीकृता । कृतश्चाहमनया मलमल्ललशेषः । हृतसर्वस्वतया चापवाहितः प्रपद्यः लोकोपहासलक्ष्यतामक्षमश्च सोढुं धिक्कृतानि पौरवृद्धानामिह जैनायतने मुनिनैकेनोपदिष्टमोक्षवर्त्मां सुकर एष वेषो वेशनिर्गतानामित्युदीर्णवैराग्यस्तदपि कौपीनमजहाम् ।
	[धिक्कृतानि = तिरस्कारवचनानि ।]
[The context is clearly indicating that Acc. form is the intended one here, but not the Nom. form.]
 
We know that धिक्कृतानि occurs in the Nom., Voc. & Acc. forms for the plural of धिक्कृत (n.).
Then, it is customary to indicate the nominal forms of the words in any gender (liṅga) or count (vacana) in the lexical works. Also, by default, the sg. is implied and not specifically mentioned [unless there is a case of ambiguity, or when both sg. & pl. forms are shown side-by-sides].
So, mentioning धिक्कृत as n. pl. is clearly wrong; it can only be either (a) धिक्कृत n. sg. or (b) धिक्कृतानि n. pl.

From this whole blah-blah, we can see that Scott is 
(a) correct at one place (it is VERY unusual for the neuter gender of such words and definitions to "require plural") and
(b) wrong at another place (I am certain that in the vast and extensive literature of the Sanskrit language, this particular word "dhikkṛtam" is NOT required to be plural).


Jim response = no change.  consistent with other MW instances.
  "mentioning धिक्कृत as n. pl." is an MW convention, I think;
     MW (or PWG) not asserting that धिक्कृत is some weird neuter plural form;
     rather meaning "the n. pl. of धिक्कृत [is used in the sense of] reproach ..."
     Very nice AB tracking down the text.
  1791 matches for "<lex>m. <ab>pl"   
     e.g. akanizWa  á-kaniṣṭha m. pl. of whom none is the youngest
  23 matches for "<lex>n. <ab>pl"
