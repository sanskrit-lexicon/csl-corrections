Also, a few hours ago, I submitted a similar correction to the word "amaviṣṇu mfn. [ID=14002 rev (1315,3)]" which I believe should be double-indented in the Hierarchy List and now placed after this correctly placed word "amaṭha [ID=13776.1 sup]" which itself follows the word "amavat [ID=13752]".

It is just a combined correction in hyphenation & accent here--
a-maviṣṇu [81,1]	-> áma-viṣṇu [1315,3]

Recall what the opening statement ("Obs.") in MW annexure (p. 1308) says--
"When no meaning is given, some addition or rectification of accent is intended."

[MW Annexure Rule No. 2]
To save space, the citation place (or the meaning) is not fully given again as in the main pages, but just the name of the work (or some indicative meaning string) is given to properly identify the meaning sense and apply the revision.

* case 49: 10/20/2024 dict=MW, L=17589.2, hw=avaniḥsaraṇa, user=srhodes
old = Placement Error
new = The supplemental insertion of this Headword should be placed just after the word "avaniṣṭhīvana [ID=17603]" in the Hierarchical listing of words, according to proper Alphabetical ordering.
Here is the reasoning: The word "avaniṣṭhīvana" is parsed as "ava-ni-ṣṭhīvana". Therefore, at this point in the Hierarchy of words, we may consider this particular alphabetical location to be designated by the double prefix: "ava-ni-".
Now, the following alphabetically placed word in the Main Entry is "avanī 2".
However, the Supplemental Word "avaniḥsaraṇa" is properly parsed as beginning with the double prefix: "ava-nis-" (or if you prefer ava-nir-) and either way, its proper Alphabetical placement within the Main Entry will immediately follow the double prefix "ava-ni-"
 Therefore, I maintain that the Headword "avaniḥsaraṇa n. [ID=17589.2 sup]" should be placed here, just after the word "avaniṣṭhīvana [ID=17603]" and just before the word "2 avanī [ID=17604]".
 Of course the ID number for the supplemental word "avaniḥsaraṇa" will likely need to be updated as well. (Super-Duper-kaching!)
comment = Placement Error
status = PENDING
In suppl. p. 1317,  avaniḥsaraṇa < avanImuKa.  
Both current cdsl order and Scott's order:  avaniḥsaraṇa < avanImuKa
Thus Both are 'wrong'.

I would like to mention that I've took these two entries as "rev" type, instead of "sup" type in my version.

Before Jim's present correction: 19248.1 -> 19247 & 19248.2 -> 19248
With Jim's present correction: 19247.1 -> 19247 & 19248.2 -> 19248

Jim response =  Relabel the two 'sups' as 'revs'; no change in position.

I wonder where and what did Scott see, to put the above statement!

See what the Comm.  (i. e. Mahābhāṣya ) on Pāṇ. 5.1.111 says--
(भाष्यम्) छप्रकरणे विशिपूरिपदिरुहिप्रकृतेरनात्सपूर्वपदादुपसंख्यानं कर्तव्यम् ।

Namely, it is talking about the root 'pad' (pad_i)!

Thus, I have the entries revised (prapat° -> prapad°) as

[19938]:	<s3>aśva-prapadana</s3>, 🠚✦ 〔n.〕 🠚⧫¦ <ls>Pāṇ. v, 1, 111, ⁅Comm.⁆</ls>//rev(1318,1)

AB comment:

All this 'farce' has started with the so called "mother-of-All" (PWG), having its entry as--
	asaunāman (asau + nāman)
	adj. den und den Namen führend Śat. Br. 14,4,2,15  = Bṛh. Ār. Up. 1,4,7. 
that has crept into all the subsequent works "as is"!

Then after pwk-5 (1884) gave its correction,
	asaunāman
	zu streichen, da Śat. Br.  (Chr. 31,29) asau nāmāyam gemeint ist.

A)	Some vigilent people took notice of the same; but just incorporated the same in their corrigenda [CCS (1887): p. 538 & MD (1893): p. 338] to "delete the entry", instead of taking action in the main pages.
B) Apte (1890), when he was at his Dictionary [he was at all his "books" single-handedly, like our Jim is maintaining the CDSL project single-handedly now], having focussed mostly on PWG and VCP & his own collection of the Kāvya literature, would not have seen the pwk-5 (or probably any pwk volume to that matter; I might do some comparative study sometime to substantiate this statement!). But the later editors of AP57 have put little extra effort in giving the BṛhĀrUp. 1,4,7 text along with the "original" meaning carried down from PWG; They have simply ignored the fact that there is no such word as "asaunāman", but it is composed of two independent words "asau" & "nāman" (as a phrase), as notified in the pwk-5.
C) Then comes our 'great' copy-cat MW (1899), who took the pwk (corrigenda) matter as suppl. info [just like our Jim is doing at times now!], instead of as a corrective info, and keeping the same in his annexure. I am reminded of Boethlingk's statement about MW's 'plagiarism' that was brought to his notice, wherein he was saying in almost similar terms, that MW has blindly translated the content (from BR's Wörterbuch) into English, without "putting" his brain any further on it. MW seems to have continued the same pattern of working even with pwk content (AND adding his own mistakes at places), while updating MW72 to MW99. [There is a saying in my mother-tongue that goes something like "Birth-traits stay with a person till death".]

Now coming to my suggestion--
(1) We should delete the entry completely as a HW, as notified by pwk-5.
(2) If we still want to retain the specific meaning given everywhere as above, we could add the phrase "asau nāman" under the entry "asau" as an example, as it modifies the combined phrase meaning from the combination of its constituent individual-word meanings
	asau = "that, such"; nāman = "named"
	asau _nāmam = "such_and_such named" [with an implied emphasis], and not the simple & plain "such_named"!
	
[It has been a very long time (ages), that I had commented this much on something.]

Now let's wait & see, what our CDSL Master-custodian Jim does (looking at this blah-blah)!

PS.
Marcis,
Recall that you were asking me to compare MW with pwk sometime back (which I did not entertain!); you may see now from this above matter, what I would've said if I did a full comparision.

Jim response =  done. Modified the entry so the headword is a phrase: "asO nAman"
        This is now the only "phrase" in MW (i.e. with a 'space' in k1).
          This 'space' causes no big problems so far in cdsl displays.
          In Advanced search, an exact match doesn't work, but a prefix search on "asO"
        or a suffix search on "nAman" both include "asO nAman" in the results.
        AB's observations on relations among dictionaries are of interest.

===========
There are both cases having "(accord. to ...)" matter "padded" in the same line ["rev" type], or separately in the next line ["sup" type].
Probably, we should find the appropriate & single strategy to follow throughout.

On a quick browsing, I see that the same line type occurs where there is no punctuation mark (comma or semi-colon) before the opening brace.
Almost all the annexure strings are on a sep. line, except 7 more such "rev" lines in my version.

 There are three occurrences of the form "R." listed in the definition of the Headword "āroha".
 Does the Revision intend to replace the "R." with the citation "MaitrS." in each and every case?
  I suspect that the answer is "YES", because no special distinction has been made with regard to this Revision; therefore it should be applied to every single case.

I had identified about 50 such new comp.-word Header entries from the annexure, while I was at the MW revision work.
So, all such are still lying 'buried' in the MW annexure for Scott to dig-out.

Jim response =  Nothing to do.  AB suggests a place of improvement:
   I think these '50'  would be identifiable only by visual 
   search in scanned images suppl.
   1. Starting at p. 1308, col. 1 of suppl., The first one I see is 
   "aMho (in comp. for aMhas)"  where aMho is not currently a headword in cdsl mw.
   2. In col 2, "a-kfta (in comp.)" would NOT be an example, since "akfta" IS a headword
   3. Another one is on p. 1309,3:  "atiTI (in comp. for atiTi)"
   4. p. 1310,1 "a-divA (in comp.)' is already a suppl. record in mw.
  Suggest Scott to make a list of all "X (in comp." from suppl. visual search.

Here, Scott 'conviniently' forgot about the annexure entry-order that he talks about time and again; and Jim has blindly followed his suggestion!

I see that its proper placement is where it was (28746.1), before this change (28545.1)!
[Note. MD & SCH also have "itānta" between "itas" block & "iti" block, just as this MW placement.
As Scott apparently likes to compare based on info from other dictionaries (Apte & SHS), I thought I should give these placements info in other dictionaries!!]

The VEI entry gives all necessary & relevant info reg. this entry; PWG's error appears to have got carried into Apte & SCH (and of course to MW72 & MW as well).
The pwk-7 [1889] has the correction duly incorporated, which resulted in the MW annexure entry.

And the MW correction here seems to be by Cappeller (!) who has the entry thus in his S2E dictionary (culled from Delbruck's article "Conjecturen zur Maitrầyanî-Samhitâ" [in Festgruss An Otto Von Böhtlingk, 1888])
This meaning is later accepted by later scholars, being perfectly befitting the context.
[Does someone like to see the original hymn?]

With the present display model (wherein both the original meaning and the revised meaning are visible to the reader) adopted by Jim, I see absolutely NO REASON to put two entries for this!!

Jim response =  done.  The VEI entry (which I did not consult previously) explains
  what is to be replaced, namely "leading out (soldiers to war), marching out".

VEI: Ud-āja is the word used in the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā1 to denote
the share of the booty of war taken by the king after a victory
(saṃgrāmaṃ jitvā). This interpretation, which is that of
Delbrück,2 is clearly correct, as against the older version,
‘march out,’ given by von Schroeder3 and accepted by
Böhtlingk.4 

> [Does someone like to see the original hymn?]
  Sure, would be good to see enough context to further understand the VEI comment.

AB comment:
==========
For the annexure entries without any homonyms ["sup": 846 & "rev": 8], the listinfo tag may be considered as working well.
[I did not spend any time looking for cases that may not be working in these.]

But, the artificial homonyms (present in the data) still have some 'influence' on this Symbol insertion mechanism, as summarised below-
(a) working in all cases of <info hui="a"/> ["sup": 47 & "rev": 1];
(b) failing in all the cases of <info hui="b"/> ["sup": 28 & "rev": 1], having an 'associated' <info hui="a"/> elsewhere that doesn't contain the listinfo tag;
[And, this 9721.1 happens to fall in the category (b)!]

So, Jim has to find a way-out for this 'flaw'!

Jim response =  Not done. See comment for possible approach.
  The hierarchy list is based solely on the FIRST instance of the citation headword;
  "First" is determined by L. In the apavarga example, the 'see' entry of p.52,1
  precedes the 'real' entry of p. 52,2. The list display allows navigation to
  the 52,2 information (the yellow arrow)
  The right-pane shows ALL the entries for apavarga.
  So, when the hierarchy list is centered on p. 52,1 the red sups in the right pane
  and the absence of a circle-S in hierarchy list SEEM to be inconsistent.
  Personally, this seems like a feature of list display rather than a bug (flaw).
  But I suppose I should devise some 'solution' from the comments of Scott and AB.
  Here's a possible solution that comes to mind:
  - some distinctive markup at 9681 (52,1) <listinfo n="rev1"/> (or listinfo n="sup1"/>
  - this markup displayed as a gray circle-R or gray circle-S.
  
  Change to the display code probably easy.

  Hardest part is to identify entries that need the rev1, sup1 markup
   AB: Would  we also need to apply the rev1/sup1 markup when there
   is a hui along with a (real) homonym ?  Or even when there are two or more
   real homonyms where one homonym has a rev/sup but the other one does not.

It's better to consider it as a print change at annexure itself and move it to 'apa-varjita' (9732.05) compounds, from 'apa-varjana' (9729.2) compounds.
Now we land at a peculiar case, that the citing (9732.05) and cited (9732.1) entries sit besides each other.

This involved a finer nuance than what Jim has noticed; but, I wonder if he may be interested in that info [which belongs to what he termed as AB's fascination.]

[BTW, I now have a fantastic revelation that would change the interpretation of MW itself, which 'remained' hidden all these days!
And with CDSL's MW digital text pervading all over the globe (for the past 25+ years), a wrong-impression got stamped in the minds of all the readers/users;
excl. me (of course!), having noticed from the very initial days that these 'lexical-termination strings' have some role to play.

It's probably the TIME now, that I should resume my filling up those lexical terminations that were missed (and/or left ignored) in the CDSL's MW text and then "reveal" my revelation to the world.
As it's going to be a REAL BIG change, the CDSL team may not be in a position to take it up under their site, so I should plan to hosting it directly at our own site. ]

Good point caught by Scott.

I also had meddled with some H1 & H2 blocks (splitting and/or merging) [along with many H2 -> H3, H3 -> H2 & similar other corrections], in my working those days (in various ways as occurred to my mind).

old = Placement Error
new = The supplemental insertion of this Headword should be placed after the word "abdabhū" in the Hierarchical listing of words.
Now, this is an interesting case for two reasons:
1) Obviously the letter "bh" follows the letter "p" and so the compound "abdabhū" follows the compound "abdaparyaya".
2) It is interesting to note that in the Supplemental section these two compounds are listed in Reverse Alphabetical Order!
I propose correcting this Error in the Main Entry. (kaching!)

With 'due respect' to the annexure entry-order [Rule No. 1], I had these two entries [note the change H3 -> H4] placed as

<L>11044.1<pc>1315,1<k1>abdabhū<k2>abda—bhū<e>4
<s>abda—bhū</s> ¦ <lex>mfn.</lex> coming from a cloud, <ls>Śiś.</ls>

and
<L>11045.1<pc>1315,1<k1>abdaparyaya<k2>abda—paryaya<e>4
<s>abda—paryaya</s> ¦ <lex>m.</lex> the change of the year, <ls>Mn. xi, 27</ls>.
<LEND> <info n="sup"/> <info lex="m"/>

Jim might also consider doing the same!

Jim response =  nothing done.  AB places these words "based on" abda,
     within the senses of abda. By the same logic, wouldn't he move
     abdArDa after 11045?  I can see some utility is such placement
     (for a base word with various senses, place compounds according to sense of base)
     but such a principle seems clearly different from the custom of MW.

The form in both cases is specified as "du.". In the "Supplementary/Revisionary" case, this "du." is also specified using the word "two". In the Main Entry, simply: "the Aśvins".
Comment 2) Please eliminate "a" and "b" and retain the single Headword "abdhitanaya" along with its "Supplemental or Revisionary" Reference and marking. Certainly a "Single Pair" can have several descriptions (supplemental and otherwise) and yet in themselves, these two Aśvins remain a single pair which does not need a double Listing from the Same Source!

Good to see that Scott+Jim team is progressing in their "rev" count (254 -> 272), in a week's time.
Still it is a long-way to reach (and probably surpass, unless I 'start' the work at my end) my "rev" count (326 -> 340).
[While going through Jim's work, I am updating my file wherever necessary; thus, resulting in the change in my count(s).]

Jim response =  Nothing to do. Jim has no systematic way to identify the remaining
                sups that should be revs.

Therefore, as the Sanksrit Language is "tagging" objects that exist in the Universe, why should we "double tag" (in this case) a single Monastery?
I suggest that we eliminate "a" and "b" and retain the single Headword "abhayagirivihāra" along with its Supplemental Reference and marking.
Certainly a "Single Object" can have several descriptions (supplemental and otherwise) and yet in itself this Monastery remains single, solitary, aikam!

MW annexure, puts a "(also)" indicator string for addl. senses of meanings, and this particular one has no such indicator. So, in theory, it should be considered as a replacement on the main pages.
But, this particular entry may go as "ONE OF IT'S OWN KIND" (are there any more such?) to have the same info on two lines, one generic (without citation) and one particular (with citation).

[This info reg. the Abhayagirivihāra appears to have been picked up from a Javanese Inscription at Ratu Boko!]

For example, the definition of the word "abhimārgaṇā" seems to fit better with the root √mṛg

For example, look at the definition for "abhimṛj" and ask yourself, "are we wiping, cleansing?". Actually, NO! we are "tracking, searching out".

Also, the word "also" is important because it points to another correction: In the Hierarchy Listing of Words there appears TWO Headwords: "abhiṣavaṇa a" and "abhiṣavaṇa b".
This DUPLICATE listing and labeling with the letters "a" and "b" is VERY likely to be incorrect; because, by the very use of the word "(also)" in the Supplemental Entry, we must understand that this supplemental definition is to be added to the existing Headword and therefore there is no need for an "a" and "b" version of the Headword "abhiṣavaṇa".
I recommend DELETING the duplicate listing "abhiṣavaṇa b", and retain the single occurrence "abhiṣavaṇa a" with the letter "a" removed and the “circle-S” Supplementary Symbol added to the right side of this word in the Hierarchy List Display.
