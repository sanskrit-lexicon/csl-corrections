For example, here we have one line that reads as follows: LB "to speak indistinctly, L. See 2. acita, aciṣṭu. [ID=1767]". LB However, the reference "See 2. acita, aciṣṭu" has absolutely nothing to do with the preceding definition: "to speak indistinctly".

There is no point in listing the form as "niḥ-kas" when in the final analysis we end up with  "niṣ-kas". I consider it best to just give the correct "final form" instead of depending on "sandhi rules" to get things right. Also, I will point out one consideration for MW online. In this case we have the following line, "Intens. canīkasīti, canīkasyate, Pāṇ. vii, 4, 84; Vop. xxi, 10  (cf. kaś, kaṃs, niḥ-kas, and vi-kas.) [ID=46861]". This may lead one to believe that the reference  "(cf. kaś, kaṃs, niḥ-kas, and vi-kas.)"  has a particular relation to the Intensive form by the fact of being "isolated" together on one continuous line (which wraps).

Therefore the word "ksiprakāma" must FOLLOW the word "kṣipraṃsuvana" in the Alphabetical order of the Hierarchy Listing. Another point to bear in mind is this: in the Supplemental section, the word "kṣipraṃsuvana" PRECEDES the word "kṣipraprasavana" (which itself supports my previous comment); therefore when adding these two words into the main entry, the "prior and subsequent" ordering of these two words MUST be maintained, otherwise the relative alphabetical ordering of these words will be violated. 1008 points!

The proof of this correction is as follows: in the supplementary section which lists the "gṛha" compounds, the supplemental word "gṛhaka" comes AFTER all of the compounds proper. Therefore, the placement of the supplemental word "gṛhaka" in the Main Entry Hierarchy MUST be AFTER all of the proper "gṛha" compounds.

old = A Supplemental Word Inserted with the Definition:  "= prec."  Will Point To The Wrong Word (in the main entry).
new = I have discovered a potential problem with all supplemental entries which specifically give the following definition: “= prec.” ; Obviously, when the supplemental entry is “inserted” into the main entry section, the “preceding” definition (in the main entry) will not be the intended “target” definition which actually “precedes” the supplemental word in the supplemental section itself. So for example, here we have the word “cīvaravat” and the “correct” preceding word (in the supplemental section) is “cīrāmbara” which gives the definition: “=cīrabhṛt”. So, in the final analysis, the “correct” definition for the word “cīvaravat” needs to be a “print change” and explicitly stated as, “clothed in bark or rags” (the definition of cīrabhṛt). Otherwise, in the main entry, the word preceding the “inserted” word “cīvaravat” is the word “cīvarabhajaka” which has the definition: “distributor of monks' dresses”. Of course the word “cīvarabhajaka” is masculine gender, and the word “cīvaravat” is an adjective. But the “salient” point is this: Every supplemental word that is “inserted” into the main entry section must receive a “print change” and have the definition explicitly stated, IF and only IF, the definition of the supplemental word is given as “= prec.”. Sorry for the long-winded explanation, but I am confident that you understand. (Shall we say 1008 points?)
comment = A Supplemental Word Inserted with the Definition:  "= prec."  Will Point To The Wrong Word (in the main entry).

Also bear in mind that Apte Dictionary maintains this "original" definition while adding "immovable, stable" (and citing the same source text). I bring this to your attention for reconsideration regarding All Revisions. It may have been better to include the "original" definition along with the Revision. I make this suggestion based upon the fact that Apte firmly asserts this "original" definition, which has been revised and therefore "omitted" from MW dictionary online. Sanskrit is an extremely flexible language and I have heard that there are two million Sanskrit texts that predate the printing press. Surely no one has read all of these manuscripts. Therefore, in my view, we should not "close the door" on "possible" original definitions, even when they have been revised. The Sanskrit Language is extremely flexible in its range of possible meanings, and therefore maintaining a "tight" closed-door policy on Revisions could be considered as "burning" definitions which actually have possible value and useage.

However, the other two words: "avatokā" and "jīvattokā" are indeed restricted to the feminine gender. Based on this reasoning, I believe that the reference quoted above needs to be particularized to the actual words being cited).

new = The definition given here is, "see satya-yajña." Now if you look up the word "satyayajña" there is absolutely no indication of the word "pauluṣita". I look forward to hearing a comment from Jim and Andhrabharati regarding this "vacuous" (and misleading?) reference which bears no fruit. LB P.S. I just disovered that the word "pauluṣi" gives the following definition: (fr. puluṣa) patr. of Satya-yajña. So here we find reference to "Satyayajña", but some explanation is still needed regarding the word "pauluṣita" itself.
comment = Investigation Needed
status = from VEI (Vedic index): 
Pauluṣi, ‘descendant of Puluṣa,’ is the patronymic of Sat-
yayajña in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (x. 6, 1, 1) and the Chān-
dogya Upaniṣad (v. 11, 1). In the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāh-
maṇa (i. 39, 1) the form is Pauluṣita, which is perhaps merely
an error.

old = Caus. -nāmayati or -namayati,
new = Caus. -namayati,
comment = Typo – Please note that according the Siddhāntakaumudī the form "-nāmayati" is always INCORRECT when used with a prefix. Here is the relevant information:  "“Gaṇa sūtra”  C.  The roots  √jvala ,  √hvala ,  √hmala  and  √nama  are optionally  मित् (mit)  when not preceded by any preposition.   LB   When they are connected with a preposition they are  मित् (mit).  This is an example of  prāptavibhāṣā.  For these roots have already been declared as  मित् (mit)  by the previous rules.  नम  ends in  अम्  and is  मित् (mit)  by the last sūtra.  The present sūtra declares an option under certain circumstances."

comment = Typo – I am just pointing out that both Apte and Shabda list this definition in the "neuter" gender. This seems to be the norm in such cases, but here MW clearly says "masculine". Not sure if this is a printing error or if we should ultimately accept both genders. In any case it is Two (Apte and Shabda) against one (MW). (I usually go with the majority rule according to the learned).

comment = Typo – Please note that this supplemental insertion has "lost its reference" to the word definition of "plok" (which follows it in the supplemental section). My view is this: when inserting a supplemental word into the main entry, a reference made with simply the single word "and", should continue the statement given in full. Otherwise, the only way to trace the definition is to refer to the printed page. I prefer MW online to give the meaning (without further research).

comment = Typo – Please note that this supplemental insertion contains two supplemental words sharing a single definition. I believe that it is your standard protocol to list both words with definition together for each Headword. Also, in this regard, the Headword "plok" [ID=141579.1] should be relocated in the Hierarchy Listing to just after the Headword "plugi". Of course both listings will share the identical definition, as is your standard procedure: "plugi and plok ind. onomat. sounds used for a Nidhana". (108 points!)

Please note that this correction extends all the way to the word "vikramorvaśī" [ID=194217] ; and then of course Globally to every similar instance. This is my firm opinion and the printed text confirms this conclusion as the number "2" is not "carried" to subsequent compounds in the printed text, since the very placement of any given compound makes the etymology clear.

Why carry the number "2" to subsequent words (which have no number 1),  when as you can see here, the same treatment is not used with compounds following a number "1" word usage. If you insist upon carrying the number "2" to all subsequent words (as I have been pointing out), then you are required in all fairness to do the same here with the number "1" carried to all subsequent compounds. Of course I am relieved that here you have done so and hope that you will delete the carrying of the number "2" to words which have no number "1" to speak of.

The previous case cited and submitted carried the "number 2" to all of the related words although in each case those "related words" had only a single listing in themselves without any "number 1". So I suggested eliminating the "number 2" from ALL of those related words. Here my "wish" has come true and I cite and applaud this case as an example to be declared as "śreṣṭham". Please follow this type of listing in ALL other cases and never carry the "number 2" to ALL related words which in themselves have no "number 1" as well.

By this fact alone, no compound form can be made directly from "1. vipruṣ". Therefore, any compound formation must by necessity be derived from "2. vipruṣ", which is also obvious both by placement and definition. Also since this is not a homonym, no numbering is necessary and only creates confusion in the minds of neophytes.
