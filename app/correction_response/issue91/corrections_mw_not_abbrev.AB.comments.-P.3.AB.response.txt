comment = Supplement or Revision ? 
Please note that this appears to be a revision (at lease in part) which should be directly imiplemented as stated:  "(for ‘lapis lazuli’ read ‘cat's eye’ [= vaiḍūrya], and for go-medha read go-meda, ‘zircon’ or ‘jacinth’".
I believe this needs some reconsideration.

status = PENDING no change.  cdsl has the full supplement text,
  which seems a reasonable solution to this complex entry.

It is not out of place to reiterate my prev. statement that more such "sup" entries are to be treated as "rev" entities!!

Jim: move 104665.1 to 104663.1, and mark as 'rev'
old:

Also change '<listinfo n="sup"/>' to '<listinfo n="rev"/>' in 104663

AB:
So, you (for a change!) have opted NOT to apply the revision to the "intended" entry content as such, but to keep the same besides that entry!!
Jim response: nothing to do  Yes,
I thought the <chg> approach here was too complicated; and the
revision entry, when placed just after the entry being revised,
 readily understandable.

  An interesting question: should it be nikAma H2 ?
  If so, then nikAma-kAma would be H3.
  
AB comment:

See my comment at case 36 in the file posted earlier [corrections_mw_alpha (AB comments).txt].

Probably I should repeat the same here again, as below!!
[No entry-block (print paragraph) has <e>1 [Devanagari (the very first word) with Roman italic] and <e>2 [Roman bold] rendered together anywhere in the whole work; they only occur at the beginning of the entry-block (print paragraph) and the entries inside the block will always be <e>3 (in bold letters) or <e>4 (in italics) in the main pages.]

Jim: No change.  But see comment for why I thought this "An interesting question"
  Here is a train of thought that supports marking nikAma as H2 and nikAmakAma as H3
  Note (in print) °kāma  (and bold) 
  That initial° indicates that nikAma is formed from the root of the prefixed root ni-kam;
  nikAma is not a 'compound'.
  Since it is not a compound, it cannot be in MW's 3rd line:
   "The third or branch line in thick Indo-Romanic type is used for grouping together under a leading word all the words compounded with that leading word."
  If nikAma is not in 3rd line, then it should be in 2nd line of MW's 4 lines.
  Then nikAmakAma, as a compound of nikAma, would be in MW's 3rd line.

  This markup pattern occurs in prefixed verb paragraphs of MW.
  I view it as a 'space-saving' alternate to the usual H1,H2,H3 pattern;
    An example of the 'usual H1,H2,H3 pattern' is aMs, aMsa, aMsakUwa.
  
AB:
There are innumerable H1 entries in Devanagari followed by H3 entries starting with ° (in bold); just compare nikuJc in the same page as nikam. As I've mentioned, no print paragrpah has H1 & H2 together.

Now coming to "aMs, aMsa, aMsakUwa" that you;ve mentioned, just note that "aMs" is in one  para and "aMsa, aMsakUwa" are in another para!

Jim response: nothing to do. Yes.  My point is that, for the prefixed-verb paragraphs,
 MW has chosen to use an abbreviated form (which he does not describe in the preface),
 and that it would be clearer to convert this abbreviated form into the
 form of aMs. 

 In applying my theory to the nikuYc example, 
 all those °X bold words in the paragraph would become H2 (analogous to aMsa).

old = (N. of a poet, Cat.)
new = N. of a poet, Cat.;

comment = Typo – Please note that this entire word along with the definition are contained in parentheses in the printed text.
Since MW online is not placing "Headwords" in parentheses, I am suggesting eliminating the parentheses altogether.
My main point is this: there is no reason to place the "definition" in parentheses while leaving the Headword itself bold and independent.
The definition is the definition, it is not "parenthetically" the definition.

AB comment:

Just FYI, my version has, in all such cases, the braces enclosing the text matter in the manner truthful to the print; here even the HW is put inside the braces.

Jim: changed . Does AB have this marked as <e>4 (due to non-bold, italic, roman type)?

AB:
Yes, I had all those [198267 to 198282.1] entries as <e>4!

Jim response: nothing to do. So you are using the font-type of print as predominant factor.  I seem to be focusing on the other non-font factors of the 4 MW lines.
 I often wonder what a purely alphabetical form of MW would be like.
 This might be more like PW, except for prefixed verbs.
