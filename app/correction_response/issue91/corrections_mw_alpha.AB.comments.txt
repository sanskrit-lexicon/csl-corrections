The confirmation of this correction can be understood from the placement of the denominative form "aghāya" which occurs in the main entry after the word "aghala". This proves that the proper placement of the denominative "aghaya" should come just before the word "aghala" in the main entry Hierarchy listing.

new = The supplemental insertion of this Headword may be better placed just after the word "aṅkulī" in the Hierarchical listing of words. The absolute proof of this correction is as follows:  the word "aṅkulī" itself is a supplemental insertion, and the word "aṅkūraya" follows the word "aṅkulī" in the supplemental section. Therefore, when these two words are inserted into the main entry their alphabetical placement relative to each other must be respected!

AB comment:
This should better be left under "uras" group as a comp. word, as listed in the annexure by MW editors.
Jim: done -- moved under uras group of body (37251.1, after uras-vat).  Debatable.

Though it could be under "uro" group as a comp. word as suggested by Scott, the "uro" group occurs much later alphabetically; and, there are couple of other entries (incl. one group)  listed in the annexure prior to it.
So we have to respect the relative placement (sequence) of the supplemental entries, which "principle" is also at the back of Scott's mind!
[Incidentally, this "uras" group at annexure has two "uraḥ-" comp. words as well, though the "uraḥ" group occurs subsequently as a different Entry-head in the main pages; wonder, how Scott missed these two!!]

And it may be seen that there are few other such groupings (°ḥ- & °o- comp. words) under "°s-" entry; as at 
--(no °s- comp. words) "atas", "adas", "anyatas" and "okas"
--(with °s- comp. words, where °ḥ-° precedes °s-°) "adhas" and "tatas" [the current suppl. group "uras" also belongs to this set, but listing °s-° before the °ḥ-°; so we might consider relocating those two entries accordingly.]

new = This Headword (which is a supplemental insertion) should be placed before the word "ūrṇuta" in the Hierarchical listing of words. The reason for this is because, the word "ūrṇāyu" is not a simple compound, but rather a derivative form, and therefore it must be placed after the proper compounds which are simply formed from the initial word "ūrṇā".
