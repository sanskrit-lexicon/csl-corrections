Response from Edge copilot for 'what does "ripe for death" mean?':

     The phrase “ripe for death” typically means that someone or something is at a 
     stage in life where death is imminent or expected. 
     It often implies that the person has lived a full life and is now at an age 
     or condition where death is a natural progression. 
     This phrase can be found in literature and poetry to symbolize the natural cycle       of life and death, much like how a fruit becomes ripe and ready to be picked1.

So in the Hierarchy Listing of words, we have not yet reached the location of the dual prefix "abhi-ā-" which is used in the Headword "abhyāśrāvaṇa". But the Headword "abhyāśa b [ID=13472]" is Precisely at the correct Alphabetical Location in the Hierarchy Listing of words where we find the dual prefix "abhi-ā-" preceding the letter "ś".

The main body entry for amavizRu occurs on p. 81:
  The current text shows:  (Did AB make this 'áma-viṣṇu' revision?)
  áma-viṣṇu mfn. (√mū -√1. mīv, NBD.), immovable, RV. x, 94, 11.

But the print on p. 81 shows:
  a-maviṣṇu mfn. (√mū -√1. mīv, NBD.), immovable, RV. x, 94, 11.

The supplement text on p. 1315,3 is:
  áma-viṣṇu (RV.)

mw72: amaviṣṇu amaviṣṇu, us, us, u (fr. rt. am),
going in different directions, up and down.

pw: amaviṣṇu (mū = mīv) Adj. unbeweglich Ṛv. 10,94,11.

gra: áma-viṣṇu, a., mit Ungestüm andringend [víṣṇu].
                    (Google: pressing forward with impetuosity)

conclusion: There are two derivations of this word.

SCOTT MERGED ORDER (acc. to Scott cases 27-30)
araja, arajanIkfta, arajas, arajaska, arajovittA, arajAya

printed order for main and suppl:
p. 86,2  : araja, arajas, arajaska, arajAya
p. 1316,1: arajanIkfta, arajaska, arajovittA

SCOTT MERGED ORDER **IS** CONSISTENT WITH PRINTED ORDER !

CDSL current merged order:
araja, arajas, arajaska, arajAya, arajanIkfta, arajovittA

CDSL  MERGED ORDER **IS NOT** CONSISTENT WITH PRINTED ORDER !
merged current order is inconsistent with p. 1316 order
  arajanIkfta, arajaska
araja, arajas, arajaska, arajAya,  arajanIkfta, arajovittA

Solution:
 move arajanIkfta 15041.1 -> 15038.1
 move arajovittA  15041.2 -> 15040.3
Now, the CDSL REVISED merged order = Scott Merged order.

new = The supplemental insertion of this Headword should be placed before the word "arajaska" in the Hierarchical listing of words. The reason for this ordering is because it precisely follows the order given in the Supplementary Section. This order can not be violated in the Main Entry Section. However, there is a further point of consideration: In the Main Entry, the word "arajas" precedes the word "arajaska". And this supplemental word "arajanīkṛta" while preceding the word "arajaska", must ALSO precede the word "arajas", and then this will be the correct placement: after the word "araja" and before the word "arajas" we will place the word "arajanīkṛta" (i.e. in-between 'araja' and 'arajas').

The reason for this ordering is because it precisely follows the order given on the printed page of the Supplementary Section.

the first arkabanDu is in group with arkabAnDava
Thus, by our current practice, these two words are 'tied together'
However the suppl. arkabanDu gives an alternate to just one member 
  of this group.
We can't "break inside" this group for the suppl.
Thus, next best thing is to place the suppl. just after the group,
which is what is done.  This second is marked with circle-S.

NOTE: 
1. There are currently 2357 'phwchild' instances.
2. The child text is, in current instances (e.g agasti, agastidru),
   'somehow' drawn from the parent text.
   In our current arhaRIyatama example, I copied the entire text.
3. The placement of the child is (currently) independent of parent placement


I could have coded this example as a 'group':
<L>16491.11<pc>1316,3<k1>arhaRIya<k2>arhaRIya<e>2
<s>arhaRIya</s> ¦ <lex>mfn.</lex> worthy to be honoured (<ab>superl.</ab> <s>-tama</s>), <ls>MBh.</ls><info n="sup"/><info lex="m:f:n"/>

{{Lbody=16491.11}}
<LEND>

But this 'group' approach might not be appropriate for the agasti, agastidru
example.

comment = Typo – I understand that this is a revision. However, after checking with the Pāṇini rule cited here, the relevance has to do with "nature". Now, MW in the revision takes the word "nature" to relate to the sense "salt". However, the word "nature" may denote "characteristic" which brings us back to the original Main Entry definition printed here as "not salty". This is (another) perfect example, where the "original" definition should continue to be retained (as an option for the reader); of course in whatever manner you deem to be appropriate (i.e. with the line through the original meaning, or whatever).

My view is this: when inserting a supplemental word into the main entry, a reference definition such as "= prec." should be "directly stated". Otherwise, the only way to trace the definition (in a very certain way) is to refer to the printed page. I prefer MW online to give the meaning (without further research).

old = Placement Error
new = The supplemental insertion of this Headword should be placed just after the word "avaniṣṭhīvana [ID=17603]" in the Hierarchical listing of words, according to proper Alphabetical ordering. Here is the reasoning: The word "avaniṣṭhīvana" is parsed as "ava-ni-ṣṭhīvana". Therefore, at this point in the Hierarchy of words, we may consider this particular alphabetical location to be designated by the double prefix: "ava-ni-". Now, the following alphabetically placed word in the Main Entry is "avanī 2". However, the Supplemental Word "avaniḥsaraṇa" is properly parsed as beginning with the double prefix: "ava-nis-" (or if you prefer ava-nir-) and either way, its proper Alphabetical placement within the Main Entry will immediately follow the double prefix "ava-ni-". Therefore, I maintain that the Headword "avaniḥsaraṇa n. [ID=17589.2 sup]" should be placed here, just after the word "avaniṣṭhīvana [ID=17603]" and just before the word "2 avanī [ID=17604]".

Please note that the placement of this word "avākchruti [ID=18501.1 sup]" appears to be WRONGLY PLACED even on the printed page of the supplementary section. In my view, we must correct this mistake. I believe that the word "avākchruti" is actually a variant by Sandhi Rules of the word "avākśruti". In other words, the two words are identical, but they vary in appearance on the basis of a Sandhi option! BOTH words derive from the word "1. a-vāc mfn. speechless, [ID=18483]". In the case of the word "avākśruti" it is properly placed within the Main Entry itself. However, the supplementary word "avākchruti" is itself WRONGLY placed on the printed page under the word "avāk (in comp. for avāñc)”. This is not a "print change", but rather a "placement change"!

On the printed page, between the words "aṣṭāgṛhīta" and "aṣṭācakra" THIS ONLINE LISTING of "aṣṭāṅga [ID=20254.1]" (within the Hierarchy Column) DOES NOT EXIST (on the printed page)!

new = DELETE THIS DEFINITION along with [ID=20254.1]  AND [ID=20254.2]. Please see explanation below.
comment = ERRONEOUS LISTING – Please note that the Headword "aṣṭādaśa" has TWO CORRECT PLACEMENTS: 1) Placed just before the word "aṣṭādaśan" AND SPECIFIED AS FOLLOWS "aṣṭā—daśa mfn. the eighteenth, VS.; ŚBr. [ID=20267]". This is the PRIMARY occurrence of the Headword "aṣṭādaśa" and perhaps should be NUMBERED as "1. aṣṭādaśa". BECAUSE there is a SECOND PROPER occurrence of the Headword "aṣṭādaśa" which is listed in the Supplementary Section Here "https://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/csl-apidev/servepdf.php?dict=MW&page=1318". It is SPECIFIED AS  "aṣṭā-daśa (in comp. for °śan)" in the Supplemental Section, BUT THIS HAS BEEN OMITTED FROM THE ONLINE HIERARCHY. The PROPER PLACEMENT of this OFFICIAL SECOND LISTING of the Headword "aṣṭādaśa (in comp. for °śan)" SHOULD BE NUMBERED AS "2. aṣṭādaśa" in the Hierarchy Listing AND PLACED just prior to the word "aṣṭādaśadhā ind. in eighteen parts, Sāṅkhyak. [ID=20269.1]". Since "2. aṣṭādaśa" is the compound form of the word "aṣṭādaśan", it therefore follows the word "aṣṭādaśan" and PRECEDEDS the compounds that are listed here beginning with the Main Entry compound "aṣṭādaśadhā ind. in eighteen parts, Sāṅkhyak. [ID=20269.1]". It is very confusing to have the Headword "aṣṭādaśa" listed twice WITHOUT MAKING THIS DISTINCTION CLEAR. The numbering of "1. aṣṭādaśa" AND "2. aṣṭādaśa" ALONG WITH THEIR PROPER PLACEMENTS IN THE HIERARCHY LIST WILL MAKE EVERYTHIN CRYSTAL CLEAR. But currently it is extremely confusing to have the ERRONEOUS DUPLICATE ONLINE LISTING AS "aṣ°ṭāṅga and °ṭā-daśa, see below. [ID=20254.2]" placed between the Headword "aṣṭāgṛhīta" and  "aṣṭācakra". This ERRONEOUS placement of THE  DUPLICATE LISTING OF THE HEADWORDS "aṣṭāṅga [ID=20254.1]" AND "aṣṭādaśa [ID=20254.2]" DOES NOT EXIST IN THE PRINTED TEXT AND IS SIMPLY A CONFUSING ADDITION TO MW ONLINE!

Otherwise, the only way to trace the definition is to refer to the printed page. I prefer MW online to give the meaning (without further research). This could be considered as a "Global Correction" to all supplemental insertions that contain "id." as the reference definition.

However, it is worth noting that SHABDA dictionary reports as follows: LB आगम्य¦ mfn. (-म्यः-म्या-म्यं) LB 1. To be approached, accessible. LB 2. To be acquired. E.  आङ् before गम् with यत् aff.

  I did not add homonym markup, though that's a good point

Here is the reference opinion, I think, from temp_cfr_extra1_insert.txt:
Supplemental Insertion – Missing Symbol Please add the "circle-S" Supplemental Insertion Symbol to the right side of this word in the Hierarchy List Display. 
Also, please note that "technically speaking", this Headword should be split into "āgamya 1" and "āgamya 2". The reason being that this Supplemental Definition is NOT an "indeclinable participle" in nature. Rather it is more akin to an adjective in nature. I understand that you will not make this distinction, but if I were "KING", I would issue a decree that it be so. (kaching!)       Supplemental Insertion – Missing Symbol

In other words, MW dictionary cites the word "āyudhapiśācī" (defined as) "excessive fondness for fighting."  Now, here is an interesting consideration: Will you add this MW dictionary citation to the actual Headword itself which appears in the supplemental section and is listed as "āyudhapiśācī [ID=25954.2 sup]". For my own purposes, I consider the definition "excessive fondness for fighting" as a "Main Entry Definition" (since it indeed occurs within the Main Entry), and as such, I have placed this cited definition just prior to the supplemental definition given as "f. the fondness of a demon for fighting." (kaching!)

One other point of consideration:  There are three occurrences of the form "R." listed in the definition of the Headword "āroha". Does the Revision intend to replace the "R." with the citation "MaitrS." in each and every case?  I suspect that the answer is "YES", because no special distinction has been made with regard to this Revision; therefore it should be applied to every single case.

P. dyati (cf. ā- √4. dā), to bind [ID=91425] LB And Finally, look at the words listed in relation to "uddā 2":  LB ud-dāna n. the act of binding on, fastening together, stringing, MBh. [ID=32936] LB "ud-dita mfn. bound, tied, L. [ID=32945]" LB The above two words seem to fit better with the original (unrevised) main entry definition. Please comment.
comment = Revision Error?
status = PENDING no change ? Jim cannot untangle.

32935, uddA (print p. 188,1):        2. ud- 4. dA, P. 
32935, uddA (current cdsl display):  2. ud- 3. dA P.  

32935, uddA (print p. 1322,1)    :   2. ud-dA (read 2. ud- 3. dA)  


3 dA for do, to cut
4 dA cf. A- 4 dA, to bind, only in dIzva

old = upa-parīṣa
new = upa-parīkṣa
comment = Typo – Headword Typo worth 1008 points! (but at least the supplementary symbol is present). Please note that the alphabetical placement within the Hierarchy will need to be adjusted. I suggest placing the word "upaparīkṣa" just before the word "upaparīkṣaṇa". In addition, for my own Sanskrit Mapping, I am placing the word "upaparīkṣā" just after the word "upaparīkṣa", since the word "upaparīkṣā" is essentially the feminine form of the word "upaparīkṣa", and therefore "antaraṅga" (so to speak) to the word "upaparīkṣaṇa" which is "bahiraṅga" (so to speak) to the prātipadika of "upaparīkṣa". Now all this having been assimilated, you will further need to state the definition of the word "upaparīkṣā" rather than simply "id.", if you choose to execute all of my above suggestions, which I have followed for my own mapping purposes. Bonus Points?

old = hiding-place
new = hiding place
comment = Typo – Please note that this is a suggested "print change". It seems unusual to hyphenate these words.
status = not changed
hiding-place occurs 22 times in mw, "hiding place" occurs 0 times
Current Edge browser spelling is "hiding place"

Note: Webster's 1828 has 'hiding-place'  (so maybe not unusual in MW 1899)

That would be a good book title! Go for it Jim!).
