01/12/2022 12:42:07	MW	 124040	pitṛdevatya	pitṛ́—devatyá mfn. = prec.	pitṛ—devatyà mfn. = pitṛ́—devata	1) ṛ should not be stressed, the common rule is that only 1 syllable in a word may be accented; LB 2) devatya bears not acute, but grave acent in the originale; LB 3) because this realization of the Lexicon is broken, one can't see what is "prec."; this "prec." must be specified explicitly (as it takes place, for example, with the "next" in the ("next") "pitṛdaivata" subarticle). (Such kind of "prec."'s are numerous in this machine lexicon.)	Vladimir Grekov
