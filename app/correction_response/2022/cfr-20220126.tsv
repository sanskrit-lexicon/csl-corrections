Moreover the A should be À (wherever the A is begining a sentence, it is and should be À; in the past the accents where not always put on capitals for economical or practical reasons but now it is no more the case so it looks strange that the A which are and should be À are not having their accent.	Happy New Year 2022 to you also, regards, Caujolle.
