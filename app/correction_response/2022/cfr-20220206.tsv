When looking at the scanned page one realises that the entry should actually read "vapana", the "n" unfortunately however is almost exactly above the "Ś" from "ŚBr" (Śatapathabrāhmaṇa) thus rendering the lemma to vapaṇa instead of vapana.	Should not be a separate entry in the first place but added to "vapana"	Typo	christiane@whitecreek.net
