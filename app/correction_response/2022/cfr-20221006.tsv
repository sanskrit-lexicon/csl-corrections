10/06/2022 08:09:29	MW	 206989	वैदिक	If you click the printed edition of the dictionary the word is "Vaidika" pronounced as "Vaidi" + "Ka", while in Devanagari it is written as "Vaidic" (वैदिक) .	Either the Devanagri version should be vaidika (वैदिका) or English word should be "Vedic" to mirror Devanagari.  The reason of confusion actually arrives because i am not sure how did we arrive at this word from "veda", which sandhi can we utilize to create this word Vaidic (Vedic) from the word Ved/Veda? LB 	Typo/Logical error.  Any information on this matter will be greatly appreciated.	pankajdoharey@gmail.com
