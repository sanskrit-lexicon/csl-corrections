01/30/2022 14:39:18	BUR	 12994	madhura	mœlle	moelle	There are just a few words using oe and not œ in French, here, mainly only this one (in 21 entries) and its derivative "moelleux" (at least 2 occurences (i mean in two entries)) are used and need to be corrected. Also, "cœrciteur" (at antaryāmin) and "cœrcition" (at yama and yāma ). I noticed also gœnsis instead of goensis (Latin) on the paper book . Also at kanyā it should be aloe and aloes.

I noticed also on the way that the abbreviation "ang." is not referenced, it stand for "anglais" (it appears also as "angl." and there it is referenced but as "Anglais"; this should be corrected as "anglais" ("Anglais" mean "English man") ) OK, LB At karman typos : LB L'Acte. en métapaysique; > L'Acte, en métaphysique; (2 corrections : coma and h) LB  l'Acte producteur des choses, l'acte suprême de Brahmā. (coma and not dot) LB L'Acte symbolique du culte, l'Œuvre sainte;  LB la pratique des cérémonies pœuses [opposée a la religion spéculative]. > pieuses instead of  pœuses.  LB -  siége, no it is siège (there is at least 42 occurrences of this mistake) LB -  at kḷp pœme instead of poème LB -  at gavākṣa œil-debœuf instead of œil-de-bœuf LB -  under bala, LB balakṣa m. (kṣai) blaucheur; pâleur. LB It should be blancheur, not blaucheur LB Moëlle also is present and it is written so in the paper book, but it is a mistake, it should be in fact « moelle » (moëlle has been used long ago but) all the other occurrences of the word in the dictionary write « moelle », so better to keep moelle, to be consistent. LB -  Under  bhaginī : sœuren-la-Loi should be « sœur-en-la-Loi » LB -  Under śaṇa "anglo sax." Is not referenced, it should it stand for « anglo-saxon » LB -  Under saubhadra : sœbhadreya is a mistake, it is saubhadreya (on the paper book the letter has been put up side down leading to look like œ (as in this disctionary they use an ao ligature for au (and this ao ligature whih doesn’t exist in the French i think the just put the œ one up side down for creating it ; but here they forgot to reverse it) LB So now i checked all the œ of the dictionary (and more on the way) ; for the Latin i checked the paper dictionary but i cannot garantee that the dictionary is not mistaken .
