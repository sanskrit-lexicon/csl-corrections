Because in this regard, the prātipadika Headword is “mahimati [ID=161411]” and here, the feminine vocative case is clearly printed as “mahemate”. Therefore, the spelling given in the Headword “mahemati [ID=161620]” should be corrected to the feminine singular vocative form printed under the Official Prātipadika Headword "mahimati [ID=161411]". And just to be clear, feminine vocative case is clearly printed as "mahemate", thereby proving the Headword “mahemati [ID=161620]” is INCORRECT.	srhodes@snowcrest.net

The form "aprasaṃga" is misleading because it looks as if the derivation is from the root √gam. But in fact the derivation is from the root √sañj. Consider this: अ + प्र + सन्ज + घञ् । Monier Williams recognizes an Etymological distinction between the following words: "saṁga" (from √gam) and "saṅga" (from √sañj). Therefore, we need to be careful with "interchangeable" letters which sometimes obscure the finer details which are conveyed beautifully in the Sanskrit language.	srhodes@snowcrest.net

03/07/2025 15:52:46	MW	63518	gatārtha	understood, (a- neg.), vi, 34	???	Question: I hope that Dr. Dhaval or Andhrabharati can clarify this point: Is the meaning: "understood" being given for the Headword "gatārtha", or is this meaning to be used for the Headword "agatārtha", due to the parenthetical expression: "(a- neg.)".

03/07/2025 17:49:18	SHS	2419	abjayoni	BRAHMA	BRAHMĀ  or  BRAHMAN (m.)	Typo – Please note that this name only applies to the masculine form of the word: "brahman" which is declined as "brahmā", in the masculine nomintative singular. But, here SHABDA says, "BRAHMA" which APTE declares as meaning, "The Supreme Spirit, the Absolute". However this is NOT the correct meaning of the Headword: "abjayoni" as which has the sense of "born from a lotus". Therefore a correction MUST be made here according to one of the two suggestions given above.	srhodes@snowcrest.net
