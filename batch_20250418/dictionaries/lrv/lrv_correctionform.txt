Case 1304: 04/17/2025 dict=LRV, L=3331, hw=arkanayana, user=srhodes
old = Śanaiśchara

comment = Typo – Please note that we cannot have "partial" proper transliteration (i.e. 'ś') and "partial" secular phoneticism (i.e. 'ch') occurring in a single word. Please consider this to be a Global correction across all dictionaries – that will save us from repeatedly making such a correction. The important point here is that the letter: "ch" is misleading, because the correct letter is: "c".
