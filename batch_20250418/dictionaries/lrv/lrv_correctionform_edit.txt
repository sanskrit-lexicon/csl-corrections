Sanskrit Lexicon Correction Form History for LRV
As of April 18, 2025
278 correction records, with 278 PENDING

Notes:
0. Many global changes. See readme_lrv_global.txt

1. Case 165. In iast transliteration of a proper name, capitalize first letter. 
 This is not possible with current cdsl markup
2. <pc> element needs revision thoughout to indicate
   page and column.  Current system (p-X) what is X. often NOT a column number
3. homonym markup
old = Headword Listed Twice  (83)
  These are homonyms. The lrv pattern appears to be
  '{%(I)'  {%(II)' etc.
  '{%(I)'  3753 instances.

Therefore, we need to be careful with "interchangeable" letters which sometimes obscure the finer details which are conveyed beautifully in the Sanskrit language.

comment = Typo – Please note that two corrections have been made here: "ṣ" for "sh" and the short vowel "a" rather than the long vowel "ā". The caste is named with a short vowel and this follows the printed text. Also, please note the word "ambaṣṭhī" that is included above. It is not written as: "ambashṭhī", and this supports the correction of "sh" to become "ṣ"; which as you know is common correction that is suggested.
