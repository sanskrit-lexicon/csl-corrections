**AB comment:
There are a lot more such places (over a few thousands!) that are to be grouped together as HWs.
My current revision has properly brought all these thus, in front of the 'broken-bar'!

Note.
There are more such line-breaks introduced by Jim (that defy proper "flow" of thought/understanding) in the CDSL text, which I did not correct at the moment (thus keeping the no. of lines in tact, for Jim to correlate).
However, I would like to properly parse the whole data in the next phase, by assuming a "free-hand" (in my style)!

* TODOx Case 187: 01/29/2025 dict=AP, L=2331, hw=antavat, user=srhodes
old = 2 The god of the space or atmosphere
new = 2 m. The god of the space or atmosphere
comment = Typo – Please note that this is a "print change" as we are marking this definition in the Masculine gender. This correction is proven on two accounts: 1) This definition is a substantive and not a qualifying term; 2) the citation itself which exemplifies the usage is declined in the Nominative Masculine gender: "antavān".
status = PENDING

**AB comment:
We can get to the proper meaning by tracing the citation (MBh. 3.197.5) (from शिबिचरितम्, at MBh. 3. 197 ch. of Bombay ed.)
[The Crit. ed. of MBh. (BORI) has this episode at the appendix-I, 21.70 (p.1072).]

    atha purohito rājānamabravīt prāṇarakṣārthaṃ śyenādbhīto bhavantaṃ prāṇārthī prapadyate. ||4||
    vasu dadātu antavān pārthivo'sya niṣkṛtiṃ kuryāt ghoraṃ kapotasya nipātamāhuḥ ||5||
[Nīlakaṇṭha (in his Bhāvārthadīpikā commentary) explains thus-- “घोरं निन्दितमनिष्टसूचकमित्यर्थः । मृत्युदूतत्वात् कपोतस्य । अन्तवान् दिगन्तानामीश्वरः ॥”

The Engl. translation (by M.N. Dutt) goes thus--
    4. Thereupon the priest thus spoke to the king, “Afraid of the hawk, this pigeon has come to you for his life with the intention of saving it.
    5. The learned men have said that the fall of pigeon on oneʼs lap forebodes a great danger. The king who understands men should save himself by giving away wealth.”

While Apte gave the meaning "The god of the space or atmosphere" (considering ईश्वर as a noun), the PD has given the meaning as "possessed of the end (of directions or quarters)" (considering ईश्वर as an adj.).
I would like to take the meaning as "the god Yama [Death], the Dikpāla of South" (which has been indicated by Nīlakaṇṭha.)
[M.N. Dutt also meant the same.]

Long story short, yes, we should consider this meaning to be denoting the masculine gender.

**Jim comment  Maintaining the current AP markup style: {%m.%}

old = full of strong inside

comment = Typo – Please note that this is a suggested "print change", based upon what sounds like better English.
status = PENDING

**AB comment: 
It should rather be corrected as in AP90--
    "full of strong inside -> full or strong inside"
The citation from Daśakumāracaritam ("˚sārāṇi indhanāni" Dk. 132) is for this meaning!
[If interested, one can have a look at this work alongwith the commentary.]

* TODOx Case 302: 02/03/2025 dict=AP, L=2374, hw=antya, user=srhodes
old = (1000,000,000,000,000.)
new = (1000,000,000,000.)
comment = Typo – Please note that this is a suggested "print change." In mathematics, one billion = 1,000,000,000 ; Therefore, 1000 billions = 1,000,000,000,000 ; The number printed here is actually "1000 trillions" which of course is incorrect. Unless "billions" is supposed to be "trillions"? Please confirm.
status = PENDING

**AB comment:
This is a clear case of changing the (Old) "British" English to (Modern) "American" English that Scott is proposing and Jim is undertaking many-a-times!
In olden times, the British meant "billion" as 'million millions' at least until the world war II; thereafter they too slowly switched to 'thousand millions' (when the American influence started over-riding other British terms)!
However, we need to keep in mind that all the dictionaries we are dealing with now were "composed & published" in Old British style!

Finally, here is the proper understanding of the word--
The Līlāvatī defines "antya"as "sahasralakṣakoṭi" = 1000 (sahasra) × 100000 (lakṣa) × 10000000 (koṭi) = 1000,000,000,000,000.

**Jim comment:

* TODOy Case 331: 02/05/2025 dict=AP, L=2396, hw=annam, user=srhodes
old = See Below
new = Attention Dr. Dhaval and Andhrabharati • Here is an example of why l like to go through Sanskrit Dictionaries. Please note the following word referenced here: "bahiḥsrotas": LB -gatiḥ f. the passage of food, gullet (cf. bahiḥsrotas). LB ——NOW, this word: "bahiḥsrotas" is not found anywhere else. Please confirm that this word exists and that the definition is: "the gullet, oesophagus." Thank you.
comment = See Above
status = PENDING

**AB comment:
Here it appears to refer to "annavāhisrotas", which is a neuter word (used in Medicinal works) having the meaning ‘गलनाडी’, i.e. gullet.
This word was first mentioned in WIL. [Scott would definitely be happy to find it in his favorite work SHS!]
However it is strange that Apte didnʼt "list" it inside his dictionary!
Do we change this as "-bahiḥsrotas -> -vāhisrotas"?

**Jim comment  NO CHANGE -- not clear how to correct this error in AP
  
------------------------------------------------------------------------

* TODOy Case 353: 02/06/2025 dict=AP, L=2401, hw=anya, user=srhodes
old = -daivatya
new = -daivata
comment = Typo – Please note that this is a possible "print change". MW gives this word as: "anyadaivata"; APTE gives "anyadaivatya". LB The question is: Are both forms correct? Or is MW right and APTE wrong? I checked another source and found only confirmation for the form: "anyadaivata". I hope that Dr. Dhaval or Andhrabharati will give a clear answer.
status = PENDING

**AB comment:
The pwk gives "anyadevata", "°devatya" and "°daivata".
The PD has both "anyadevatya" and "anyadaivatya", with supporting citations!
So, both Apte and MW are correct.
**Jim comment NO CHANGE

* TODOy Case 354: 02/06/2025 dict=AP, L=2401, hw=anya, user=srhodes
old = -dharman
new = -dharma
comment = Typo – Please note that this is a possible "print change". MW gives this word as: "anyadharma"; APTE gives "anyadharman". LB The question is: Are both forms correct? Or is MW right and APTE wrong? I hope that Dr. Dhaval or Andhrabharati will give a clear answer. I like to know the correct prātipadika for the purpose of declension.
status = PENDING

**AB comment:
"-dharman" can denote a substantive (either masculine or neuter), and even an adjective many-a-times.
MW also had many adj. words terminated in "-dharman" (though not this particular one)!
[For a change, I thought I should better be 'not clear' (i.e. inconclusive) here.]

**Jim comment:  NO CHANGE  
BEN : "in the later language hardly ever used
except as a substitute for dharma, when
latter part of a comp. adj., e. g. vidita-, adj. Knowing one's duty"

* TODOy Case 363: 02/07/2025 dict=AP, L=2410, hw=anyatra, user=srhodes
old = (anyatra = anye).
new = (anyatra = anyasmin).
comment = Typo – WITH UPDATED HEADWORD AND ID:  Please note that this is a suggested "print change." The equality stated here appears to be referring to the Locative form of "anya", which is NOT "anye", but rather "anyasmin". Also this appears to be applicable to the following "Number (4)" definitions listed as: "Otherwise, in another way, in the other case, in the other sense"; and therefore, perhaps this correction should also be moved accordingly so as not to appear with the "Number (3)" definitions: "Except, without, other than"; but rather at the Head of the "Number (4)" definitions.
status = PENDING

**AB comment:
This is defined as "<ab>oft.</ab> with the force of the <ab>nom.</ab> case", just before the citation [copied form the PWG "as is"].
As such, the "(<ab>oft.</ab> = {#anyasmin#} with a <ab>subst.</ab> or <ab>adj.</ab> force)" [at the top] is not being referred here. 
So, no change required in my opinion.

**Jim comment NO CHANGE

* TODOx Case 460: 02/17/2025 dict=AP, L=2694, hw=aparavat, user=srhodes
old = aparavat a. Like what follows.
new = aparavat ind. Like what follows.
comment = Typo – please note that this is a suggested "print change". The affix 'vat' here is being used as APTE himself defines:  "-ind. An affix added to nouns or adjectives to denote 'likeness' or 'resemblance' and may be translated by 'like', 'as'." LB This instance of the word  "aparavat"  does not carry the sense of:  " An affix added to nouns to show 'possession'; धनवत् possessed of wealth; रूपवत् beautiful; so भगवत्, भास्वत् &c.; (the words so formed being adjectives)."
status = PENDING

**AB comment:
Scottʼs keen eye is appreciated again!
Goldstücker alone mentions it as ind. giving a proper explanation; while MW & Apte have just followed Böhtlingk (PWG).
It is not out-of-place to mention here that Goldstücker had spoken much against Böhtlingkʼs understanding of Pāṇini [in his work (Pāṇini: His Place in Sankrit Literature)]! (Is Scott having any interest going through that?)

comment = Typo – Please note that this might be a "print change".  ALL of the following Four Dictionaries: MW, Shabda, Vācaspatyam and Kalpadruma – GIVE ONLY the spelling as "apariṣkāra". Only APTE gives the short vowel spelling. APTE STANDS ALONE and AGAINST four GREAT authorities. Does Andhrabharati have anything to say?
status = PENDING Jim: no change.  Many sources for 'pariṣkara'

**AB comment:
While the word "pariṣkara" does exist as noted by Jim, the meaning given by Apte (for "apariṣkāra") does not come under it; as such it should only be "apariṣkāra", as Scott mentioned.

old = °cakṣus of unequalled brightness
new = °cakṣas of unequalled brightness
comment = Typo – Please note that this may be a "print change". MW dictionary gives the word "apākacakṣas" which is verified in the Ṛgveda (viii , 75 , 7). We need Andhrabharati to authorize the word given here as: "apākacakṣus". Or is APTE in error?
status = PENDING

**AB comment:
While "cakṣus" can have a meaning 'Lustre, splendour' (as Apte mentions), the ṚV. 8.75.7 does vouch for "apākacakṣas" (meaning 'of unequalled brightness').
It is definitely a print error in both AP90 & AP57, that needs to be corrected.
BTW, the PWG has a print error for this hymn number at L-4042 (8,64,7 to be corrected as 8,75,7).

* TODOx Case 535: 02/24/2025 dict=AP, L=2893, hw=apahā, user=srhodes
old = apahā 2P.
new = apahā 3P.
comment = Typo – Please note that this may be a "print change", pending confirmation by Dr. Dhaval and Andhrabharati. The reasoning is as follows: 1) The root √hā is listed as a "class 3" root by both Apte and MW.  2) MW lists the prefixed root "apahā" as class 3.  3) In the three citations here, provided by Apte, each "example" of the usage of "apahā" is given in the absolute (indeclinable) form: "apahāya", which does not in itself establish the root class.
status = PENDING

**AB comment:
The root √hā occurs in class 3, with two different meanings (and listed in the Dhatupāṭha separately).
It is obviously a print error in AP57, that needs to be corrected.

new = ???
comment = Typo – I hope that Andhrabharati may clarify this: I am uncertain why there the Headword contains an initial short vowel "a", and in the definition the reference with an initial long vowel "ā". Should not the Headword also have an initial long vowel "ā"? Why has the initial vowel been shortened?

new = arthādanapetamarthyam  "Śabdānuśāsana" by Hemacandra, (Bṛhadvṛtti, Part 3)
comment = Typo – Please note that you likely will not make this "print change". I simply give the exact quotation to make the following point: The anusvāra is not used when followed by a vowel (at least in classical Sanskrit). I am no expert in Vedic Sanskrit. The rule quoted by Apte is simply in reference to the "ablative case" being used in this particular construction. But the actual quotation is from Hemacandra, and I have corrected it above according to the Authority of Hemacandra himself. Would Andhrabharati like to say anything?

comment = Typo – Please note that this is a possible "print change" based upon my current dictionary of Sanskrit words. For the word given here as "apehiprakasā", I have the word  "apehipraghasā". Perhaps both words exist. We need Dr. Dhaval or Andhrabharati to confirm this.
status = PENDING  Jim thinks no change : GST also has apehiprakasA. Also mw72
  mentions apehi-prakasA under apehi

**AB comment:
This word (apehipraghasā) is from Gaṇapāṭha of Pāṇini; "°praghasāḥ" (voracious people) appears more appropriate here.
GST might have looked at a faulty edition (or manuscript) of the cited works, for mentioning "°prakasā" in his dictionary.

comment = Typo – Please note that this is a possible "print change". I do not find the word: "upodakī", however APTE himself lists the above three feminine forms in relation to this reference under the Headword "upodaka". Does Andhrabharati have anything to say?
status = PENDING
  Jim thinks NO CHANGE

**AB comment:
Scott has approached me directly about the "upodaka" entry on 16th Dec. (two weeks ago) and I had replied him (on 19th) at https://github.com/sanskrit-lexicon/csl-corrections/issues/103#issuecomment-3675313000; and he had submitted a correction thereafter (which is at 10240 in the 'cfr' file).
Jim may do the needful accordingly.

**Jim comment
Note the comment link from Andhrabharati:
"upodakā does not appear anywhere else, other than in Apte; 
 we can safely consider that it is a print error (-kā for -kī) 
 in AP90 and thus in AP57."

Jim interprets AB to 
The AP print is:  see upodakI
The current ap.txt:  see {#upodakI#}
Jim Concludes:  
1. NO CHANGE for L=3052.
2. However, print change to upodaka entry L=10240 (-kA -> -kI)
**pc: 10240<pc>0475-1<k1>upodaka : -kA, -dikA, -dIkA The plant Basella Rubra : -kI, -dikA, -dIkA The plant Basella Rubra

Quite simple: the "ā" at the beginning of °ākhya is to be deleted, resulting into "apratisaṃ°khya(khyā)nirodhaḥ" as in AP90 [dual forms: apratisaṃkhyanirodhaḥ & apratisaṃkhyānirodhaḥ].

**AB comment:
Though Pāṇiniʼs rules result in "abhicārikā", the word "abhicārikī" also does occur in literature. [Ref. https://www.wisdomlib.org/definition/abhicariki]
It is for such cases that different schools of Skt. grammar arose, most of which treat the "apāṇinīya" words.
The grammars are there to explain & ratify the words occurring in the words literature. There could be many words that do not got noticed by the grammarians;  Scott has mentioned in one of his posts that Skt. literature is a "super ocean" [both in width (subjects) and depth (numbers)], that cannot be wholly fathomed by any person (or to that matter, by any number of persons)!

**AB comment:
The PWG mentions "abhīṣāh", which came into MW72 and Apte and few others.
The pwk mentions "abhīṣah" (in Vol. 1) that got copied by MW; however MW has (conveniently) skipped what the pwk did in Vol. 5 as amendment (i.e. adding abhīṣāh) ["abhīṣah , füge (stark °ṣāh) hinzu"].
It is yet another slippage by MW (we can keep on counting such cases, which I would estimate as going to few thousands)!
BTW, the citation given by MW for "abhīṣah" is the same as in PWG (RV. vii, 4, 8), that has "abhīṣāh" only!

**Jim comment 
"abhīṣah , füge (stark °ṣāh) hinzu"
"abhīṣah , add (strong °ṣāh)"  (Google translate)

My understanding of the AB comment is that this is a print change

old = Chālukya
new = Cālukya
comment = Typo – Please note that we cannot have "partial" proper transliteration (i.e. 'ā') and "partial" secular phoneticism (i.e. 'ch') occurring in a single word. The important point here is that the letter: "ch" is misleading, because the correct letter is: "c". Also, it is worthy noting that MW dictionary translates this particular definition as: "N. of a Caulukya prince." Does Andhrabharati consider this definition to be better one way or the other: "Caulukya prince" VERSUS "Cālukya prince"? Perhaps both ways are admissible as "Caulukya" is the Name of a king; and "Cālukya" is the Name of a dynasty. Therefore, the "Prince" may be referred to either way?
status = PENDING

**AB comment:
1. It is a daunting task to normalise the Skt. transliteration in many Indian works (of lore), as there is no easy means to do so.
2. As far as the point of Cālukya & Caulukya is concerned, they are not same.
(a) Cālukya dynasty was ruling at Southern & Central parts of India between 6th and 12th centuries. (b) Caulukya dynasty was ruling Western parts of India between 10th to 12th century.
3. Finally coming to Amoghavarṣa, there were three of them-- (a) Amoghavarsha I (c. 800–878); (b) Amoghavarsha II (r. 929–930) & (c) Amoghavarsha III (reigned 936–939 CE), all belonging to Rāṣṭrakūta dynasty.
Amoghavarṣa  I was referred to in the PWG [Ref. H.H. Wilson, Select works, Vol.1 279. 332] & Amoghavarṣa III was referred to in the pwk [Ref. Bombay Asiatic Journal, 1.217].

On the whole, both Apte and MW were wrong here; but Apte could be considered closer to the fact, having mentioned "Cālukya" that is linkable with "Rāṣṭrakūta" dynasty!

**AB comment:
Both "N. of Aṅgiras" &  "N. of Aṅgirasa" are used to describe a person and are accepted forms.

old = arca

comment = Typo – Please note that this is a Headword Typo and possible "print change", based upon the MW dictionary analysis of the ṚgVeda verse 6.34.4. – Here the form used is in the instrumental case: "arcā". This requires the prātipadika to be "arc", as corrected here. Apte also, confirms the exact same citation.
status = PENDING Jim thinks no change.  PWG has under arca

**AB comment:
Without going into details, isnʼt it simple to consider both the forms as acceptable?
