  03/30/2025 dict=MW, L=14235, hw=amṛtabhavana, user=srhodes
old = Amṛta-prabhā
new = Amṛta-prabha
comment = Typo – Please note that this is a possible "print change", following this definition as given by APTE. The question for Andhrabharati is this: "Was this monastery built by a man or woman?". THAT will give us the correct name here, either masculine or feminine.
status = NO CHANGE

AB comment:
No change is required in MW; on the contrary, AP57 needs correction as the word is feminine.

I understand that you may choose not to make such corrections because they may number in the hundreds. But I do have a Global Solution, if you choose to implement: Make the following target correction for every possible case: (root classes 1 through 10) and (conjugational voice terminations such as: P. Ā. U.). Such a Global "Search" and "Replace" would be thus conducted as follows: " 1P." » " 1 P." ; " 2P." » " 2 P." etc.; " 1Ā." » " 1 Ā." ; " 2Ā." » " 2 Ā." etc.; " 1U." » " 1 U." ; " 2U." » " 2 U." etc.;

comment = Typo – Please note that I disagree with listing "page breaks" online. I consider this to be an unnecessary visual distraction to the listing of definitions. When someone clicks the "page link" to view the printed page, the page break will present itself in an "obvious manner" which precludes the necessity of including such a "page break" online. This of course is my preference, and I will not be mentioning it again, however I you will give this suggestion some consideration.

comment = Typo – Please note that this word is printed in devanāgarī script. Here the word has been transliterated and it represents a proper name. Generally, proper names are capitalized in the English language, and this is a Sanskrit-English dictionary.

comment = Typo – I understand that the letter "b" and "v" may be interchanged at times, but in this case, there appears to be no supporting evidence. I am an "Old School Purest". Substituting the letter "b" for the letter "v" is simply to accomodate Barbarians who are incapable of proper pronunciation. I do not approve of such "dialects" which simply degrade the purity of Sanskrit.
