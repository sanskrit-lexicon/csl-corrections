comment = Typo – You may consider to make this a Global Correction using the target search: " ddaṣṭ"  ——becomes—–  " dṛṣṭ" • the initial space surrounding the target search " ddaṣṭ" is required to avoid ativyāpti, which I am sure will delight Andhrabharati, by my mention.

By this same reasoning, the word given as “mahemati” is INCORRECT. Because in this regard, the prātipadika Headword is “mahimati [ID=161411]” and here, the feminine vocative case is clearly printed as “mahemate”. Therefore, the spelling given in the Headword “mahemati [ID=161620]” should be corrected to the feminine singular vocative form printed under the Official Prātipadika Headword "mahimati [ID=161411]". And just to be clear, feminine vocative case is clearly printed as "mahemate", thereby proving the Headword “mahemati [ID=161620]” is INCORRECT.
