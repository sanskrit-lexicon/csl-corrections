04/05/2024 09:30:03	MW	191186	vāyin	sowing	sewing	Typo - I believe that this is a printing error based on the definition "weaving" and the etymological placement under the root √ve. Please note that "sowing" means "scattering seeds", whereas "sewing" is "working with thread". I hope that Jim will look into this.	srhodes@snowcrest.net
04/05/2024 09:35:40	MW	191183	vāyaka	sower	sewer	Typo - I believe that this is a printing error based on the definition "weaver" (which hints at an etymological placement under the root √ve). Please note that "sower" means "one who scatters seeds", whereas "sewer" is "a person working with thread". I hope that Jim will look into this.	srhodes@snowcrest.net
04/05/2024 10:22:21	MW	187677 	vartsa	vartsa	I hope that Jim will look into this and perhaps open a discussion on Github. The problem is as follows: Here we have a reference to three words: The Headword itself "vartsa" as well as "bārsva" and "vartsya". I have not been able to find any of these words located anywhere else except for this single listing in MW dictionary where nothing is defined and we are left scratching our heads wondering, "what is the point of this?"

04/06/2024 04:48:17	MW	107850.2	nikāya	of, Buddh.  Sūtras,	of Buddh. Sūtras,	Typo – I believe that these three words are part of the definition being offered. Therefore, the portion "Buddh." is merely an abbreviation for the word "Buddhist" and should NOT be set apart in a different Font Style from the preceding word "of" and the following word "Sūtra". I believe that the word "Buddh." is simply a modifier to the word "Sūtras". Simply put, "Buddh." should not be made to appear differently in your "scripting language" from the word "of" and the word "Sūtra". These three words are all meant to be rendered in the exact same way as a SINGLE coherent phrase. I hope that Jim will look into this correction himself.	srhodes@snowcrest.net

There is the Headword listed as "śreṭī" AND there is the Headword listed as "śreḍī". Therefore, it is unreasonable to ignore the listing of the Headword "śreḍhī" which is given equal status here with the other two words, as all three are listed together. As a further point of interest, the Apte Dictionary lists only the Headword "śreḍhī" which I am insisting needs to be included in MW dictionary. Otherwise an unreasonable inconsistency is being maintained which does not due justice to the magnificence of the Sanskrit Language. I hope that Jim will agree with my reasoning and make this correction. Thank you very much.	Missing Headword	srhodes@snowcrest.net

05/25/2024 03:40:29	MW	97805	drāvaka	enchanting	cunning	Typo – Please note that this is a very serious error. An entire definition has been misrepresented. I am very pleased to make this correction (and it is worth 1000 points).	srhodes@snowcrest.net
05/25/2024 03:49:44	MW	106080	nārasiṃhopapurāṇa	N. of an, Up.  and an Upapurāṇa	N. of an Up. and an Upapur.	Typo – Please note that this correction follows the printed text. The printed text does not indicate any reason to "change the coding" as you have done in the online edition. The form "Up." and "Upapur." should remain in "the same coding" as the entire definition itself. Perhaps you prefer to deviate for some reason? I prefer to follow the printed text and keep things simple. We are not referring to "the names of some other text"; MW dictionary is simply stating a definition which happens to be the name of an Upaniṣad and an Upapurāṇa. There is no "external reference" intended here. This is also a consideration for a Global correction to the Many Many instances of this exact same sort.	srhodes@snowcrest.net

Apte lists this particular definition as "neuter gender". In MW dictionary the previous definition was listed as "m. or n." And this option of gender has not been "cancelled" or "restated" in any way. Therefore the gender of this particular definition should remains as "m. or n." or revert to simply "n." which was the previous gender listed. Please see the printed text. The "masculine gender" has not been specifically stated here and therefore it is an error make this assertion.	srhodes@snowcrest.net

05/26/2024 15:05:22	MW	77578	jayādevī	N. of a, Buddh.  deity	N. of a Buddh. deity	Typo – I prefer to follow the printed text and treat the definition in a pure straightforward way. To change the coding of "Buddh." seems to me unnecessary and strictly incorrect. This sort of issue occurs many times in the online MW dictionary. If there is no direct reference to another "work or text", then I maintain that the entire definition should be treated in with the same coding (font style) thereby following the printed page.	srhodes@snowcrest.net
